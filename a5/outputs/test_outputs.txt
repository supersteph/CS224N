You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can look like a farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk about circles.
And you know that an epidemic is usually something that got you somewhere in place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as an epidemic.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollywood.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the '60s in the middle school, at Stanford, Ohio.
And they beat up to blood every week, until a teacher saved me life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the teacher's room.
He did it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the 1980s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I got a phone call from that teacher, Mr. Pole who said, "I need to see you.
I'm desperately disillusioned that adults never get to know.
You could come to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stick with this please.
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland, OK.
We went to see it, we laughed, we cry, and we realized that she needed to be hospital.
We found it a place, and we internal it, and we take care of her family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so the woman who wanted to meet me as a adults came to me, became a boxes box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed into a circle -- and that expression that I talked about was made in itself.
The hope is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her one.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
I need truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature, and it's all interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first sharks.
I was amazed.
My heart called fast, I was raining, trying to understand what was in front of me.
And the sharks around me would get up from the water almost 60 meters. And I couldn't think that it was a snowball on another year of snow year after year.
The shames are born when they get away from glaciers or break the ice booms apart.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are denied to stay and hang up to the end, whereas others can't get it more and demonstrate in a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a transparency, that are signal isolated and alone, largely as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a iceberg melts, I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg is developed releases rich water water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I get closer to photographing these sharks as if you were about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that at these unique moments there are that way and won't exist that way again.
It's not the death when they're delivered -- it's not an end, but a continuation of your way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the sharks that I photograph is very young -- it's a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are a shark I photographed in Kestoner, Greenland.
It's very often to really get to present a round ship.
Here you are.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your leading line.
You can see here, starts rolling around, the boat has moved toward the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a German iceberg of average size.
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so nomadis, the iceberg shows one different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each containing a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of consciousness, because if you stop thinking about consciousness, you're not going to pay attention to you.
Let's think about it for a moment.
And in this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the sperm X of sperm is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
They both think about and started life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
And so in my activity I get two roles.
In one of my roles -- I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a hostile historian and what I study in this case is the way people put anatomy -- I mean, human bodies and animals, how the body fluid, the idea of the body, what have thought about the body.
The other role I play in my work is an activist, as a defense of patients or, as I say sometimes, defense of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working with, for example, with simple twins, two people within one body.
I've worked with people with environmentalists, much lower than the middle of the media.
And I've worked with many cases of people with outliers, individuals whose physical psychology doesn't fit in the male schools and conventional female schools.
On general lines, we can call it introduction.
The intrinsic adopted many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not in male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with X-ray whose SRL and the SRI gene, and it says to the protests, that we all have in the federal life, which becomes tested back.
And then, in the fitted life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual individuals of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the supply syndrome to the advertisers.
So, there are high testosterone levels, but without reaction.
As a result, the body is developed by following a typical funding course.
When I was born, the baby has a little girl.
It's a girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breasts. But it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing it, they realize that instead of having ovarian and torture, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called super-edged glands.
They're on the back of the body.
Surgeon glands produce antibiotics, the hormone of manufacturer.
Most women like me -- I think a typical woman -- I don't know its crime structure, I believe being a typical woman most of the women like me are sensitive to anthropologists.
We produce anthropologists and respond to the advertisers.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the additions that the woman who was born with testicles that have the syndrome of inspiration to the advertisers.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the internstering are in the middle of the spectrum -- in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as a variety, and I had neighborhood, and sexual relationships with her, I had a life as a boy and I just found out that I had ovarian and toughness.
He had an extreme way of a disease known as a super-exposure hydrogen.
He had the 20th chromosomes and the super-edge glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were missing, their brain was exposed to the typically male composed hormone component that they were involved.
I was born with a child, no one suspected anything.
And it went at the age of 19 when he started having medical problems caused by the internal message, when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of introduction.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what you know as bonders, which is to say, they have controversial tissue wrapped in technological tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that these kinds of bodies -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- are being end, simple twins, or international surgeons -- they get into normal surgery is not to be able to get better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that a number of surgery is that they are a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have female identity, presumably being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with catastrophe.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture about individuals.
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born as two people within one body.
The latest case is last year with the South African corridor, Cartoon Semiatrochure -- put his sex in the International Globes of Berlin.
A lot of journalists called to ask me, "What are they going to do to determine whether Casey Ferment is man or woman?
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't make a living line between men and women or between men and women and women and women and women, and women and women, and women and women.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science advances, the more we have to admit that these categories -- which we thought were static anatomic categories that correlate directly with stable identical categories -- are much more difficult than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology allows you.
As we see, we get into a scarfing terrain.
Let's see, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
So what are we going to do with the fact that they have a few noses, just a few nuclear?
And as we progress in science we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we manage are probably too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the realm of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body gets human, and it has different rights.
There are very academic arguments today -- maybe not in public, but I know in medicine -- about when someone considers death.
Our ancestors never had to go to this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of people put a pen in front of the nose, and if it moves it still didn't bury it.
If I stopped moving it out.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to face the dilemma to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this exploration of categories could be addicted to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progress, I mean people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
To realize that these categories are much more unstable.
Think of the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I am a profit of the Foundation of Foundations of Foundations.
I know they were rationals, I know they were sexually, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find every so much watching that music about 177, and not by music, which is totally expensive.
That's why happened in 1777 with the Foundations Fortunes.
The founding parents were for me, the first anatomy activists and I explained why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers what our parents recorded was the idea of monarchy -- the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming through the right of the blood transferrent to the father and then the son, and so on.
The founding fathers rejected that idea and replaced it by a new anatomical concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They released the game camp and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the anatomic differences -- that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of an illustration system where two things were going on.
It was recovering democracy and at the same time was born science.
And it's very clear, if we look at the story of the Foundations of Foundations, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were getting away from the supernatural explanations and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power transmitted by going from an idea of a birth of birth.
They were moving into a natural concept.
And if we look, for example, the Declaration of independence, talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence we were transferred to the idea of anatomical coincidence.
And by doing that, they were sitting the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women succeeded.
Then I came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the Suring Tree California, who said, "I'm not a woman."
We found men in the row of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who applied to the anatomical opinion about the anatomical difference and again, they succeeded.
We see the same thing with the Disability movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at consciousness, we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain diversities.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomic division in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should give us to the anatomy of the anatomy, I don't want to say.
I don't mean that the five years of five years were allowed to have sex or married.
There are some anatomic division for me to make sense that I think we should keep it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two consistent beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings -- both concerned in middle 1979, exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary attribute all of the rights three months before to Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to drink ...
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other rares in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man, I haven't told you if it's X-ray, in virtue of being considered man now is a passion of the mandatory transition that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary for his part, it doesn't have the same rights to the marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So they still persist anatomical categories that in various aspects are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science goes so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be disappeared?
I don't want to give up to science, but at the same time I feel like science gets stuck.
Where are we going?
It seems like what's happening in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it."
But many people have been trapped in a weird position.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided that to marry a man don't have to have chromosome, and to marry a woman you have to have a chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't do chemical tests to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the inspiration syndrome to the advertisers.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I have to give a solution on it.
It says that we should judge people by giving people not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their character, getting beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems very good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their care?
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I am not sure that we should be based on this to guarantee people, because I have to admit that I know some of the things that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some borders that I know can make more informed decisions and smart and mature decisions about their sexual relationships that I know.
So how do you put in practice the subject of the character content.
It turns out very difficult.
And one part of me is wondering what happens if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with a magnetic MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still holding this stream of thinking in relation to democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless it's willing to get to a sex change, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made light giant twins and then separate them and get her fame up.
But when I asked him the reason why the operation was asked -- I was a very risky operation, and it responded to me that in that other country, these kids would be very multiple and therefore I had to do it.
And what I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States provides huge possibilities to people to be who they are without forcing people to change for the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about parents.
And I want to think about how democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given greater involvement to mothers.
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist female, and that is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different anatomical technologies, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in introduction, I've also been interested in researching sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about traumatic studies is that women, on average, not all, but on average, tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in the graduate one, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered feminist -- as I was now, made me a strange plan.
"Tell me what the feminist has female."
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminist has to do with taking gender stereotypes down, so there's nothing female in feminist."
But the more I've thought about his question, the more I have seemed to be a female female in the female.
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very encouraged to find a way to protect people in the part of the state, it's possible that we had more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the recover of recovery.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond anatomics, thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect Union, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks about where each family is going to live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents in the world.
Well, right now we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they value much more than their building cost.
So we could easily deliver the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this might sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just replace them for apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners, and that at the other half still would still be able to do it.
And they could try to increase the ability to make amplifies in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem you face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid motivations and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those amounts.
But they could go to a completely new place, building a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place facilitate construction instead of putting it out.
So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under status.
Later, I learned that more or less at the same time, Japan and October were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 speakers would go out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, Honduras.
In the next regular election, Peter Louring was implemented with a platform in which it promises reforms and at the same reconciliation.
He asked October to be his boss of garage.
Meanwhile, I was preparing me to give a talk.
Through a process of performance, trial and error and a lot of testing with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under status to their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and bother all the current apartments of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need both technologies as rules to progress and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala.
I showed it to Japan.
They called me.
They said, "Let's show this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York. See, land that, in some cases, is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, October said, "Paul, maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a low city is a place where you start with a device -- a station that specifies the rules that will be applied there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those rules.
So the president of Hong called me and said that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go to General and talk about four and five of January, again.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in Dene.
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the honor that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that I measured at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone applied courts.
The public faces were very serious and attention.
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor Rome, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk talk.
I have it here in my computer."
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explains the essentials that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a city of a city that you might be able to be in Hongybody, instead of hundreds of miles away north.
And it would also include new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government government would need help from associated countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that would help them to establish and make the standards of the status -- so they could all trust that the status effectively becomes figured.
And we went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, 19 of January, they voted in Congress to send their constitution and add a constitutional device that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this painful crisis, the vote in Congress in favor of this constitutional message was 124 to one.
All the parties in the society, all the factors in the society, would get it.
To include the Constitution, you have to spend twice in Congress.
On February 17th, it passed over again in another vote, 114 to one.
Immediately after the vote, from 21 to 24 of February, a sense of 30 honor honors went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's building in South Korea, bigger than the Boston Center.
All you see there were built in four years, after they spent four years by doing the permission.
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, practically, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow managers to come, and at the same time, it would enable to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the last instant court for this new judicial system.
There are urbanism and cities of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that want to be installed in the Americas, especially in a place with a range of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world, there are 700 million people who say they would like to change another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to their family to get a job, sometimes they are single mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you seem to think about building a new city in Hong?
Or build a dozen of these around the world?
What do you seem to think about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my honest friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm Jesus, and this is my value.
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is that, I live obsessed with the suit.
I love to find, to dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog, attacked and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of palester markets and second hand stores.
Ah, thank you.
Second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my guerrilla in the environment and in my wallet and block.
I get to know interesting people, usually my money goes to a good cause -- my aspect is unique.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it my tall?
Am I going to like the color to do?
costs less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my journey, I want to tell you what I packaged for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does anybody bring all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought in.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothes, and nothing else.
In exactly a week for exactly a week is all I've put on my value.
I imagine that I would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after I got here to Palm Sergeans.
And because I don't know how the woman walking on TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the scores for this week.
Does it sound interesting.
As I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this bright tiger thing.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the jacket -- I was spent 50, and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
Long, color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be a bad mood, when you're looking at a bright red dot.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars, the integration is surveillated.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just do yourself.
If you surrounded you from the right people, you won't just understand you, you will also appreciate you.
Microsofter microscopes, the child that you take inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the factors, or I remember them at the age of seven years.
I like to smile, and say, "Thank you."
June: The confidence is key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside person, you can't see you can't attract you.
So there's no excuse for no one of this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Video: A universal truth of six words for you: The slow lentils go with everything.
And finally, soldier, developing a single and unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using -- and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to go emotionally to these things, because at the turn of the corner, there will always be another crazy and colorful and brilliant suit waiting for a little bit of love in my heart and looking for.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we use a scale to measure the attitude of each hemisphere we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logic.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you put your brain on this scale?
Some of these would be offered by one of these ends, but I think for most of the integrity of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great attitude in both hemisphere at the same time.
It's not that they are excellent exclusions.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that just like most other experimental quantum physicists, we need pretty logical to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like playing with things.
We get to play with them, and then we see how they react. And then we develop our intuition from that point.
And you do the same thing.
A certain intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, you can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, they developed it.
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always fell.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar was taught a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to transport them, and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you are a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really weird things -- as they can walk through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics theory.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago, they needed the quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit my intuition very well, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, never nobody saw a particles.
But it didn't fit up to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics supply.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the small metal traffic.
So what we see is a little bit of metal that we see in the form of temperature, and it sets up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this brown form of swimming patient that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in quantum support, but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people come up to stop doing those things, because I don't want them to bother them, or actually scare them.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travel companies of the invasion of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that shines it and the wind that happens on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers out.
And that's what we did.
We turn the lights off, then we introduced a vacuum and we extracted all the air, and then we face it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being just in the elevator -- the little piece of metal is free to act as you like.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered it moves in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way that he raped was like a breath in this shape -- as a forest that expands and controls.
And by giving it a smooth puzzle, we were able to make it divide and not divide at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a vibrating thing and doesn't divide at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the millions of atoms that make that piece of metal are steal and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at the same time when those are the lines.
In the rest of time, they're disappeared.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth getting into a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part that speaks to it.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, what would that be?
How would you take your consciousness if your body was disappeared in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we heat it, and we turn up the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal kept there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition -- apparently all of the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just taken in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is America.
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and that allowed me to bring it up.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of businesses and stories -- I assure you, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on it.
There are lots of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story is explained simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
A great education -- I didn't believe me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than it shows the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, just let's go to Google.
Look around all the museum there is.
There's the Fature of French, the MoMA, the Eriling, the Rummy, the God God.
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, to the Metropolitan, the New York Art museum.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and pass, we're already inside of the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombay, or Mexico, that actually doesn't matter.
You move around and get fun.
Do you want to navigate for museum?
We opened up the plane on the top, and with a single click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall.
They go forward. They're fun."
explore.
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Harrism Break Congress in the Metropolitan.
I see the sign + sign.
If the museum shows the image, we click out there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the metal information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the giant technology.
So this image, for example, contains it, about 10 billion picks.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 billion person?
So I'll show you what you really get with 10 billion picks.
It can be made around very simple ways.
There are fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really wanted to deal.
So I started playing play, and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems interesting.
I walked in, and I found that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some of the people from the Metropolitan, and I actually discovered that this is a game called unconscious, which is to hit one day with a stick, the Tuesday Tuesday step.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get us even deeper and see that you can actually get even to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, and you will really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we go quickly to jump again to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The New night studying."
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the pictures?
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this mass post?
It goes up and really does it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the start night, I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "Colonialisms.
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a manipulation, that's the same.
You can online, you can create your own museum to create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we enter -- I've created this function that I call "The power of the short, we just made a baby around.
It's about "The English in the National Gallery of London.
You can get things together, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you're contemplating these masterpieces of masterpieces to you.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium to do justice to your art work, and it's represented right online.
And the big question that you do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum?
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think that's a pixel, a flying pixel.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin -- all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it's happened something very interesting about the careers of Freedom 1 in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Freedom 1, I took a budget and I took it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering would be called real control system.
Essentially, it's a system that has two components -- a sensor and an action.
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers to free air.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and accepted.
To address cities is a big thing.
As a note I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but represents 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the energy consumption -- to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these choices and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of Paul Bonder for years at MoMA during the summer.
It's called "Talem To Me, "Hello, NSA.
Well, our objects, the environment, start to talk to us.
It's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and activists.
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when the Monster scared the Monster, he said that at the end took the hammer and handed it to the Moses -- I still can see a little ball under -- and he said screaming, "Perse never paint?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples: insisting on the idea of capturing the environment and taking something to it.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a source of luck.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup Color.
Perhaps some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the Zipmin end of the head.
And anyway, at the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity happened in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Collision in the middle and the Royal River.
It's morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
On the early evening there are people over here and there doing call, moving around.
It starts the party."
Grand de France. Gold of Italy.
Entertainment," people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time.
First extra time.
Zincond, and at a moment, the heart.
Gay Italy, yeah!
That night was going to celebrate the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they all went to the center into the middle of the winning team and the first minister of time.
And then everybody went down.
You see the picture of the place called Circus Massachus where, from the time romance, people are going to celebrate, it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection, is not about people, but things we use and consume things.
We know all about the rise of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac -- how they are associated.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project we developed a little bit of little tags to track the trash in their sponsor by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little over a year ago, to tag what they were bringing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that anyway.
Then we put a little chip, a tag in the garbage and then we started tracking it.
These are the results of it.
From Seattle.
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of ingredients in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist.
complicated things, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we remove doesn't disappear, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we throw one day still keeps there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Scared Birthday, could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mention at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in Zammy.
It all started with a question of the city mayor that came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- it was, imagine you have a cup and valves, solitarium valves that open up and shut down.
It creates like a sun court, with pieces of water.
If you get the pixels you can write on them, I'll show patterns, images, text.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so we can go by, as you see in the image.
We presented this to Mayor Bell.
He liked it a lot.
And he has a commission to design the building at the entrance of the Exploration.
We call it the Digital Water Plane.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no legs or windows but when you approach it up so you can go through.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the supernova, you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
And those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when they go down the roof, somebody who was there and he said, "Give me the building."
No, it's not that they have gone, but when it goes down almost all architecture goes down.
Here we work.
You see the people intrigued by what happens inside.
And here I am trying to not get wet.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in Zammid came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let me go, but a building that kept doing shadows and water holes and you had to jump down to not get wet.
(Climber people, and for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always incredible.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels -- water pixels and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and you have a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud.
Sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of pixels ...
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appeared in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And that then all of that could be a cloud of pictures in 3D that you can zoom in, and go through, and see from very different angles from very different angles.
This is the real Fluxon control, going down to form a V, like before.
When light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, from people's movement, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bollywest -- one of the world's best ball dancers today, the New York Station star and the State of Millennium -- to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for February.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels -- the captured in different resolution.
It's so much 3D dignity in real time as a movement capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can get all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity.
We want to use this as a possible entry for February.
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called La Cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- as a creature creature -- like grain crash, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody donated a little bit for a pixel.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last couple of years is that, in the last two decades, we move from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything as knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed you, we can move from the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today, think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collectively collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered with picks.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympic games and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So, it's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, like a new summit of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital wall at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- by a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves.
What about living with good health?
Or maybe they are those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like it?
What would you like if you could choose something?
Audience Member: creativity. creativity.
How many people choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
A few, you probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you choose the memory?
A few more.
What about the physical state.
A little less.
How about longevity?
Oh, most of that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
Is it just imaginations?
Or maybe possibly possible?
Evolution has been a place here at the TED conference, but today I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great generation of the 20th century, TED Daniel, who also ended up at the Organization Organization Russia, wrote an essay called "No biology in biology makes sense to evolution light.
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: Is it just about the past, or the future?
Do you mean others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well at one end, it is, of course, the one that interests us.
We run from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids in the toilet.
Some of them have gone back.
We've been here about 130 years old.
We might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat the diabetes?
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically inertial, which comes out of pancreas.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the most bacterial intestine than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio Damagine asks you about amputation -- think about bacteria?
The gut is a wonderfully hostile environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, headache, it's very cool.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that may want no effort from their parts.
It's really like a quick range for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some force to the output.
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest essential nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would the future?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or are you destined to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the environment?
In this vast incompatible symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief company, the animal kingdom, as one and only companies and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the whole part of this talk, so I hope you have enjoyed it.
When I got to college, I had my first kind of biology.
It was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- in most existence of life, in the single-celled organisms, every cell is just divided and all genetic energy in that cell is transmitted to the two cells.
But when the multicellular organisms come up, things start to change.
It enters sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you might say that the inevitability of the death of the body is in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student thought, well, sex, sex death, death per sex -- seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year I was happening, every time I had more doubt.
I got to understand George Burns feelings that I still acted in Las Vegas well in his 90 years.
And one night someone hits their hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent dancer of clothes.
He looks at him and he says, "Come for a sport of sex self."
"It says, "Geographic, I create the soup."
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working on a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contrasted, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to regain health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next generation and adapt and survive generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the receptor rockets designed to send the genetic charge to the next orbit and then let the sea fall down.
I think we all understand the feeling that World Allen said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality through my work.
I want to do it not dying."
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the stronger or the fastest and even the smarter.
Evolution favors creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only evidence of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean the bacteria that are afraid that they can survive the heat of the families that would produce, if there were fish there, fish in the vacuum -- yet they've managed to make that a cooking environment.
So, what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the next phase -- I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first is we don't evolved.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been disappeared and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've run our environment to adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we migrated out, and we committed so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to happen.
A second possibility is that you can produce an evolution of traditional type of traditional type by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that evolution grants roll off, but they are amazing.
And in terms of the analyzing, when as a species we colonize distant planets are going to exist the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive possibility and an intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it neurological, the new evolution, which is not just natural -- but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get this?
First we consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more variations than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what is chosen at the individual and family level.
They also think that if you could be possible to choose not only the sex of your descendence, but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
What if we could do the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the polio?
Would you not want to make those changes in your genes.
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and demands 13 years.
It cost 27 million dollars.
Next year, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost close to the dollars about 20,000 and a week.
It's not going to take a lot to do the human genome for 1,500 and be more and more to the scope of all.
Those changes are coming.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us of themselves, but they're going to induce immune against other viruses.
Believe or don't have an experimental trial in course with the vaccine against influenza.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the ship?
That's reality today, and in the future it's going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little changes.
Can you change the cells of your bodies, but if you could change the cells of your descendants?
What if they could change sperm and values, or change the very hidden flight, and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating the healing, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier kids.
And then that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt super-edges -- a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken Jones especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine.
Why don't you have a faster control muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live more time?"
This is going to be irreductive.
And when we are in conditions of doing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become evolution before in the rebellion.
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100 thousand years, and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have for them.
Are we going to use these options as a better society, more successful, more considered?
Or, are we going to be selectively different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more very restricted and more vertical?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about it: are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom required to make these decisions out?
For good or for bad, and before what I might think, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're 300 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by clicking out, click, class.
Class, click, click, class. Sounds frightening.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the 18th.
It was the only one I could talk to flight assistants.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. We probably hit some birds.
The pilot had already seen the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot aligning the plane with the Hudson River.
It's usually not the route.
The the motors off.
Imagine being in a plane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The three most disabled words I've ever heard.
He said, "Preference for the impact."
I didn't have to speak more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair -- all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never had.
While I was thinking about that, I came up with a sentence, which is, "Country vent wrong."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to use anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has actually changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we went through the George Washington Bridge who didn't have a lot of -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great nightmare.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, I have tried to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also gave place to my ego.
And I read the time that I wasted in things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a media in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like wonder.
I don't try to be right. I chose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock goes down, 15, 14, 13."
You see the water absorbing.
I'm saying, "Please fly.
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we went down, I had the feeling of, wow, die not fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go. I love my life.
And that sadness came into a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talents.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood by connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
For most of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I came up with a miracle of not dying that day.
And I came up with another gift that was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You who are flying today, challenge you to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please do not be like that -- but imagine, and how do you change?
What would they do, they still hope to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How would they change their relationships and the negative energy on them?
And most importantly, are the best parents that they are?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great one that I worked on was for this guy.
The guy called TED.
TED was one of the most important graffiti of the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a hormone in the legs."
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today TED has a total paralysis.
It can only use the eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony and TED and her cause.
So I went and reunited with his brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with you?"
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, isn't that -- I saw Stephen Hawking -- isn't that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices?
And he said, "No, unless you get somebody important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody see the movie "The Scripture and the Marine?
They communicate in that way -- they go through the finger.
I said, "That's architectural. How can it be?
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed up a crash that I had no idea how I was going to cover it.
I committed to her brother and father there at that particular moment, "All right, so this is the treatment, and Tony is going to talk about it, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous.
So I talked about a couple months later.
I met these guys named GDP "Canoli, who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser point, draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that come up, they say, are part of a cycle of life.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentation.
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side to one another, we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine so that TED could communicate, a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun thing, I call it World because talking to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't deserve it. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world -- literally all the corners of the planet -- to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved into the back of the back and these hackers and programmers, and constants and annoying took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid and that when we went back, they would have taken off the frames of the walls and instead there would be gravel.
But for two weeks we got built, we went to the Maniel Maria Cash -- my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called Edible European, and you can see the description of it.
These are a couple of cheap sunglasses that we bought on the shipping landscape of Venice, some copper wire and Home Department and Radio Shakespeare.
We took a PCS camera, we open it, we put it on a LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- it builds you yourself, we publish the free code -- the software goes down in free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There's no hospital that can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the TED room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's your room.
There was all this beautiful and stress during the great ingredient.
And after more than one year of planning, two weeks of programming -- intense session of all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and he's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and he would imagine what was the feeling of the parking thing.
The funny thing was that we had to break in the parking lot, so we felt like we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and someone finally came to rescue me and get out of there so that I could breathe.
Isn't it amazing?
In a way, that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing that.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes went from the guy, "Oh, this is fantastic."
Armstrong tweet something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all this -- and this is what ends up to close the circle, which is that in April this year at the MOLho's center at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called Art in the Streets.
And Art in the streets is going to have the world's best urban art expansions, Shelmen Favela, CACS. All of them are going to be there.
TED is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, make it possible.
Nothing that has in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the Schwarzschild, nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with eye recognition technology, just recently recognized something and I was associated with wonderful people so that they can make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find something we feel to do. If it's not now, what? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years to get into genetically very difficult situations and at the same time.
I went to jail. I went to jail.
I worked on a coal mine. dangerous.
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been diving me in horrible experiences with the only goal of trying to try to examine social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyze them in a way that looked at input and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew it would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and paradigm, I wanted to do something a little different.
So, some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took an airplane in English.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the name of my TEDTalk names in 2011.
What had been the following: "The NASA is -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and the content could explain it on the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company by doing it.
But I said this, it's a very good media opportunity.
How many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that sales I knew that somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I could not have been able to tell you with certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said before, I've been in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could be anticipated, for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Spacebone," I want to make a film that deals with the power of products, the marketing and the advertising, and the whole film is funded with products and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The largest movie ever sell."
What happens in "The largest movie ever sell, is that everything from the top at the bottom of the ground has image images, all the time, from the abstract that comes before the title, the X brand.
Now this brand, Quadrood Stanford, the Standards Center.
These people are going to be associated with the film of personality forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. Michael Kasamatic is red -- is that? MK: Is it red.
I'm a redundant peace. MK: I just say that. It was more for employees.
It was "The Personal Personality.
But we're not just going to have the X brand parasite in the title but we're going to make sure we're going to make sure we get all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe that you use.
The most cool car you ever drove in "The largest movie ever sell, the best suit you have been drinking, correct from "The largest film ever sell."
David Koran," then the idea is so much of showing the brands as part of life, make them fund the film? (MS: So I'll make them fund the film -- MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the full film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, the whole film of beginning to end.
And I would love that CEO will help make it happen.
Robert Frieded, you know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that, it's the maximum respect for the audience.
Good, though, I don't know how reconciliating people are going to be.
TK: You have a perspective. I don't know if you are a person, it's very negative. But you know how it's going to represent?
MS: A million and a half. (CA: All right. John Kamen -- I think it's going to be hard to meet with them, but it's definitely going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands.
XL: Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of us, we look at a lot of joy.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Warran, most answers.
MS: But will be hard to sell it, by the film or for being me?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, do you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good. MK: Okay.
MK: We have to think about what brands do.
MS: Yeah. MK: Yeah. MK: That's the challenge. When you look at people you have to deal with.
MK: We have some places where to go.
MS: I thought that the camera came out, it meant we have a conversation outside of a microphone.
Turn the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your film.
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought the concept of advertising was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, isn't the idea to tell with that new deal of attention that is going to take the message to mass?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a sarify mistake, and that error was this.
No, there was not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image represents this image.
See, when you look for transition images in Google --    this is one of the first images that come up.
I like your Norwegian way, Sergey Brin.
This was the problem: transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen -- easily decentralized, that is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in business practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name it, the president of the name, even the CEOs name it.
But all of a sudden when it's about making it reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency day fear --  like that weird bear that still keeps playing.
It's impressive.   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it right?
Take an entire bowl of Coke Whitopia.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell our story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie -- and there he was looking at me as I used to do -- he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard Kurder from many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take off the environment and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to warn suddenly -- what I started to realize is that when you start to convince you with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films big, big, giant movies and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make big, giant Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is to the associated brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies.
And the film is called "The largest movie ever sell."
How are we going to see Baby in the film?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my button, you'll see the design Bang.
Any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you very cool for this interview?
Are you ready? You look a little nervous.
I want to help you get stuck.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview.
And there I would offer one of these fabulous soils.
Both "Foundation Florida," as "Parades of Parama, are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like a woman, solid to ball, in clay as it is.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a custom look.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
So similar to the kind of smaller movies that you know, we're rather a rival brand.
That's why we don't have the budget that other brands have.
So doing things like that, you know, remember Banda to people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe Bangladesh?
Bank is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Volunteer: upper technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put on the alpha.
Man: We talked about something audacious -- fresh.
I think "French, it's a great word that really puts this category in positive versus choice and superstar."
It keeps you.
How do you get a little bit more time? With better frustration, more fragmentation, three times more fresh.
Things like those who set up the benefits.
MS: And that's a multi-touch company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the common Peers.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your brand.
Man: Um, my brand mark?
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: It will revive the 1980s, paralyzed point unless it's worth line.
MS: Okay, what is the German brand, Germany?
Geron, something unique. (Madly, one: Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a dark glamorous.
I like dark colors, so many gray and things like that.
Usually I get access as a sunglasses, or I like crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a classic conversation, Mr. Ben.
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it a castle "flight."
Woman 2: On part of the hypothetical, in part of you, in part of a girl Brooklyn, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of machine.
selling toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the market.
Man 5: March school failed.
Is that something?
Arthur, I'm a lawyer.
Tom -- I am Tom.
MS: Well, not all of us can be formed Tom -- but I often rank me on the intersection of dark glamour and charge flight.
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the market personality.
And I found a company called Julie Zalema in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like New New Beneful, Hall to discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
Aboad, transfer the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you live in, as people around you, your family, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
And all of those things are originated and they start in a place and in my case, and in my case they orient and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next day of my life."
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about what that serves us?
What's the machine? How do you find you now?
Why is it important to receive? What does the red.
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other metaphors have you had.
It doesn't have to be fear. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: So "I was -- Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience -- MA: Great job. A, yeah. MS: Thank you very much. All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all this.
Linus Zalema, the first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but completely, in your brand personality. The brand Morgan Space is a conscious framework.
They are struggled very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's human nature -- to avoid things that are not safe -- they avoid fear, those elements and you actually give them tired and you get something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is classical application. Apple.
And you can see here to Tahrir, Wiki, Minister of Minister of Minister and Kepler.
Now there are financial marks and conscious brands -- those things that have gone and come up with a state framework is pretty powerful.
MS: A self-destructive brand. What's your mark?
If somebody asks you to describe your identity identity, your brand personality -- what would it be?
Are you an attacked attractive, you're somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you more an attractive attractive.
A little more calened, researcher, conservative.
Adaptic attributes are like being free to be fresh as the Princeton, contemporary control, adult, adventure or bold like error, Europe Florida, fast or gift, pregnant, dominant or mystical like Galifeland.
Or are you more attacking attributed attraction?
Are you conscious, sophisticated like Blair?
Are you standard, traditional provider, protected, protect you with Obama?
Are you reliable, stable, family, trust, safe, safe, controlled or safe, like the Dalai Lama or YouTube?
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, steadies and descends, who said, "No, don't want to make part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control on the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the neuroscience, and we got to tell the story in this movie of how the magnetic resonance now uses to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing like for film.
We went to San Paulo.
All across the city over the last five years there are no values, there are no cards, no volumes, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing walks in schools with life problems in America.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects where I've had the biggest response or the ones that I've had more success are those where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these marks did.
They took the interviews, they took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think of people, which will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have left? Did they succeed.
Well, since the film is stressed at the Separation of Southern, let's take a look.
According to Buddha the film is stressed in January, and since then -- and this is not all -- we've had 900 million impressions, in the media for this film.
This cover only a two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press, no TV.
The movie is still not distributed yet.
It's still not online. It's not in starting.
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talked about told their customers will not be a part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you pull people out of that, it's pushing them out of failure.
I think that when you train your employees in the risk of the risk is preparing all your company to get rewards.
I feel like what has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We need to encourage people that they don't have fear of the opportunities that they can scare them.
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we need to give the fear of fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
We take the fear. We open the risk.
From one sense at a time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to adopt transparency.
Now more than never a little bit of honesty is going to get a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk "We "Draw Transparency has been presented by my good friends of EMD, who by 1700 bought the rights of the name in English.
PM: becoming great data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
ECX presents "Translation."
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Morger in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those 1700?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket. I have a name of the name of the TED marriage organization, the Salman Foundation, a clash for 1700 to be applied to my TED attendance of the next year.
The idea behind the South computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the engineering plant in the city in Natasha.
The gray boxes that you see are in real time control systems.
If we get to compromise these systems that control speed and valves, we can cause a lot of problems with the server.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software, they are from a completely different technology.
But if we can put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to match this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Statfic.
We started with a Windows installed installation.
The military goes into the gray box, giving the server, and the Iranian nuclear program is demand, missional mission.
It's easy, here?
So I want to tell you how we discovered this.
And when we started researching about Stanford six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown by Stanford.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the Windows part of the installation, which was using multiple damage vulnerability.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infected our environment with Stanford and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very strange things.
Stanford was behaving like a lab rat that he didn't like our cheese -- he smelled it, but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a targeted attack.
It's completely directly."
The installed is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working in that place.
If not, Stanley doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what the goal is.
It might be, let's say for example, an American energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
We better discover the goal soon.
So we went out and disappeared the attack code, and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs -- a small and a big.
We also saw that they were armed very professionally by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points for which to attack them.
You probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that Stanford installed is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very much about everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old amazing language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were called the system functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we looked for temperatures and data structures and we tried to relate them to the real world, with objective potential in the real world.
We need theories about destructions that we can approve or depend.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent software, it has to be a valuable white, and it's surely located in Iran, because that's where most infections have been represented.
You don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of Bush and the innovation plant.
So I told my assistant, "Test a list of all the experts in censorship and energy plants between our clients.
I called them and built them in an effort to build their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital book with the traffic control.
The rotor is that cell part within the center, that black object that you see.
If you manage the speed of this engine, you can certainly erase it and even make the frame explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and disappear in an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to decipher the big digital origin looking very closely on the data and their structures.
So for example, the number 165 is on that code, you can't obviously.
I started researching scientific literature about how these scores are built in National and found that they're structured in what is called a waterfall called a capture, and every waterfall contains 165 centers.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These centers in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code.
Pretty identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
So that there are no worthwards? It wasn't like that.
The results have been received after several weeks of hard work.
We routinely ended up in streets without out and we had to start again.
And yet, we discovered that both digital orbits were going to go to a single goal, but from different angles in them.
The small mile is taking a waterfall. And by turning the clothes and repairing them, and the big bird communicates with six waterfall and manipulating valves and manipulating tubes.
In fact, we're very confident that we've determined what the designer is.
It's National, and it's just Nation.
We should not worry about other goals being reached by Stanford.
So here I show you a few very interesting things that we saw, really struck me.
There's the gray box, and you see the centers on top of it.
What this thing does is to intercept people's entry values for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provide legitimate code, which still execute during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is programmed by Stanford.
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the robot, the security camera is fed from the video.
Is it great is that?
The idea here is obviously not just to blow the operator into the fourth control.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to fix a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, on an energy plant, when the great steam turbines go from speed, you have to open up flying valve in a milliseconds.
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they are compromised, then bad things can happen.
The plant can explode.
And the operations or the security system will notice it.
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is generic.
It has nothing to see, specifically, with cracks, with uranium income.
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or in an automotive factory.
It's generic.
And you don't have -- and you don't have -- to disseminate this burden with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Stanford.
You could also use cutting-edge technology to design it.
Design the most possible.
And if you did that, what you end up with is a weapons of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We must face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Rallie, it's been done in many sides that people assume that the mosquito is the main entities behind this.
What's your opinion.
Ralph Language, OK, really want to hear this?
Yeah. Okay.
My opinion is that the mosquito is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is cyber supercomputer.
There is one single one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately lucky.
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you. Thank you, Rallia.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take away and give a terrible skills, or another that makes wheelchair users go up and walk back.
In Berkeley Biondins, we call these robots, exoteries.
They're nothing different from something that you put in the morning, give you a great force, which is also increasing your speed, and helps you, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other outside people.
This is not a real idea.
To show you now what we're working on we start talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on its back a 45-year-old load -- and it's getting to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
And we decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help drive the issue.
Let me introduce you the Hulk.
Soldier: With the HIV exoskeleton -- I can put 90 pounds on variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put into cochlears to drag and execute movements with great agility to run.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
Either Benjamin, we're ready, with our industrial partners, to produce this device -- this new exoskeleton this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
We go back now to the wheelchair users, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people, in wheelchair, around the world.
About one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation.
We talk about something that happens often -- very young people, with damage in the backbone that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that aging it very quickly.
Their only choice, many times -- by brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair chair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from their success approach, as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you the ELAM that is using Amanda Boltzila who was 19 years ago he had an injury in the backbone of the body, and as a result, he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Bollywood, Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our ELAM, which I mentioned.
It has some sensors.
It's completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals into the computer of board, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the hips and in the knees, and they make it progress with this sound and very natural steering.
AB: I was 24 years old on the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom of it was paralyzed.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement of the pelvis.
Shortly after later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Ahara, you'll never walk.
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last piece of hope of my being.
Adaptation technology since then has allowed me to learn to get down in screens, scaled rocks and even riding in a hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just of soldiers, but Amazon, and all the wheelchair users to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battery, practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of day -- where diversity is serious.
And no, it's not the feminist of Man Arduino or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobo forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living parts.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their aggression.
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis in this aspect in our narrative of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, at the terrible, the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence hasn't seen yet.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least understood.
They live in the depths of the Congolese rainforest, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the tentachy -- the scene of a violent conflict that has been provided for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts in danger.
Car meat trade and deforestation make you not be able to fill out or a stadium with the bonobos that are going on in the world, and honestly, we're not sure that.
However, on this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter by making the trees.
Who are these primes?
We know them as the apes "The love, not the war -- because they have often sex sex, promised and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the Kamy Sunday.
Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish links and feed tolerance to it.
We learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the evolutionary roots of laughter and dance and human ritual.
Play is the glue that binds us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild medium.
First, it's a ball of ball ball -- and I don't talk about soccer show.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a perspective.
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You've got it from the balls.
I just believe that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common both in Bonobos like humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like testics -- and also how play requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is police.
The game is police, it can adopt many ways, some of which are more scaled, imagination, curious -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to see -- this is Fucker, a young female female, which is playing with water.
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and outer worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real seed of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key of these capabilities.
In other words, game is our footage of adaptation.
In order to adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But we're going to take advantage of our game ability.
The game is not fragile.
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans like that, life is not just cruel and delight.
When it seems like the least appropriate play, they can be the moments when it's the most urgent thing.
So primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscovered creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for development from a nonprofit organization named Robin House.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I combat fires as a captain of captain in a volunteer book body.
And in our city, where volunteers make a highly qualified staff one has to get to the site of the very early fire to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But still there was a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain of charge and figure out what our homework was.
When I found the captain of the captain -- I was self-security in a conversation with the owner that certainly came into one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end night, she was standing outside the rain, under a palaces, in pink, decline, while her house was in flames.
The other volunteer that I just came before I was -- let's call it the Lake Luther --  he came first to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog owner dog.
The dog. I was so clean."
So there was a lawyer or a gesture of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a building building to save a living one just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me an argument.
He said, "Best I need to be at home.
I need to go up, go through the fire, and give this woman a couple of shoes around."
I swear it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but I was -- I put the stairs, at the end of the hallway -- went to the real bombs that that height sort of had finished the fire and walked into the fourth main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the staircase where I met my News and the precious dog on the main door.
We took out of the house the bones for the house owner where, as it was to expect, his treasure.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house owner to thank you for the brave effort to save her house.
The kindness that she looked at on the other was that somebody had reached it even a couple of shoes.
So much in my voice at Robin House as in my voice as a volunteer and a volume of acts of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale, but also the act of grace and corruption at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved or they're going to get to, remarkable levels of success would like to remind you this: don't wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give.
They serve food on a comet, they clean up a park park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they enter the game -- they save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark coming back.
Mark Benjamers? Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great admirer of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1868 with a very simple idea: concrete modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit of construction in the world.
They've allowed us to build bigger things that we, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, LGBT came up with this.
He was called autonomous assembly blue.
And in a few years, LEDs of LGBT came to all households in the world.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineering to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LGBT made it accessible.
LGBT just adopted the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly the same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce the new building block.
The transistor was a small piece of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex circuits -- a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Allies.
I'm going to show you how they work.
The Little Bills are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're ready to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they get together by images.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks.
The green is the salt, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly you can start making older circuits.
A blue with a green person produces light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a regulatory.
If we change the button for a pulse cord, which is here, and now we have an intellectual light.
We add this guy to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond simple play, Little Little Allences are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and solve, Little Allies allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make a faster or slower, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind Little Allies is that it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to be reduced to beautiful bricks.
Luckily, sound, solar panels, motors, everything must be accessible.
We've given Little Bitches to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that doesn't learn in schools.
For example, how a night light works, or why the door of an elevator stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken Little Allies to design schools.
So, for example, the world designers with no experience start playing with Little Allists as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and fish, we have George create.
(Music sounds)  A few weeks ago, we took Little Intelligence designers at Rhode Island School designers, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard and wood and paper, and we said, "Make something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done, an active confidence canopy.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a length made of plathaker that is afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, LOLcats became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all the stuff.
So Little Allegations has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and make them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world that we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So, ahead and invent.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for us with the environment by focusing on the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Member. Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of carrier.
We can -- we can continue to leave the video on a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I am already afraid of time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they are supposed to detect, we ask them to work in government.
The initiative was called Code for America, and they would be like a peace of peace for technological people.
We selected some of the members every year, and we put them to work with the municipalities, and we put them out to work with ammunition to work.
Instead of sending them to the Third World, we send them into the wild world world.
They made great applications. They worked with municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
You know it.
This is a hydrophone of Boston City.
So here it looks like if you look for a quote, but what really looks for is someone clean up when it gets caught by the snow because it knows it's not very good to turn on fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
So how did it come to ask for help of this significantly.
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of Community in America.
They were there in February, and at that moment I kept a lot last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these hypersonic heroes.
But one of the members named Erik Michaels noticed something else, that citizens cleaned up with sticks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, he developed an app.
It's a nice application in which a hydrant can be adopted.
You accept to clean it when I snow.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case I put it in.
If you don't do it, someone can relax.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 programmers last year.
But it does something that no other government technology is done.
And it's spread in viral form.
A responsibility of Houston City systems when we saw this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to adopt signature services.
It's very important that they work these tanks of tsunami, but people steal the battery.
So they ask citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens pass the demographics off.
And Chicago just launched it to make people record to clean up when they snow.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spreading without friends, in an organic and natural fashion.
If you know a little bit about government technology you'll know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that required three and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that we had done it for normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the judicial power of California that until the moment has cost two billion dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is programmed in a couple of days, and it's disabled in viral form is a kind of advanced to the institution of government.
It suggests government better ways to work, not like private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without restrictions and open and generation.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the question of the government that has the new generation, not as a problem of a self-destructive institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we work together with efficacy.
And it's not just Code for America, but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to civic apps every day in their own communities.
They have not been given by the government.
They feel a great frustration of that, but they don't complain -- they fix it.
And these people know something we've lost of view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row at the DMC -- and all those other things that are putting us crazy, the government is, essentially in Tim Rule, what we do together because we can't only can."
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to recognize it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change, government.
And given that the government in the last range of us -- remember that of "We are the people, the way of thinking about how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was going to pick up people so that they can get charges.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is above all, matter of alternatives.
This is the center of the telephone care of services and information.
It's the place that the calls are called, if you mark 31 in America.
Scott got this call.
Ron Zargo, at the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. I started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, can you open up the door, put music right and see if you go?
And it worked. So by Scott ...
But that wasn't the end of the alternatives.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app and web and cell phone, called Cinnusation Connection.
We don't program that app.
It was the work of very smart people at the New York City Office of Boston.
One day, this really happened to come up with this question: Zacketry in my trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it take it?
The Center of Cities Connected is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Cities Connection everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, I saw it a neighbors.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
Zargooli? Yes. Live? Yes.
I turned the cube. I went home.
Good nights, shore shock."
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to engage and help others.
So, a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it might have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we shape communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but they think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then hope that government reflects our values and satisfaction our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of 15 centimeters, the supercoutuating layer.
Below is what we call burrel.
And we say that word with a lot of decentracy.
But it's that description that holds that that it belongs to us that we finance as something that operates in our against our contract, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sensory.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We have to collaborate with government machinery.
That makes the October movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of the SPS "County on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's burializing active.
And for those of us who have resisted in the government, it's time we ask ourselves what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see enormous challenges that they'll have to face.
Do you really think we're going to get where we have to go and solve the institution that can act in behalf of all of us?
We can't preserve government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can expand to the civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it knows that it's not so hard to act done a domestic basis, there's only one to articulate the systems in the right way.
And the age average of our members is 28 years old, so I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk about, they're all going to speak.
You can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem doesn't care much to make their voices.
They're using hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaned up a hydrant -- taking out the weeds -- empty a garbage cube that has a farmer inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as a digital reminder that we're not just consumers -- we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we don't fix the citizens.
So I want to ask all the present, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all together, will we be a crowd of voices, or will we also be a hundred hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and in the death row.
I've spent most of my life in commercially marginalized communities, projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that say here are impact around the world.
In fact, if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that would have no other way.
I mean, because I think identity is really important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, which is if it's cartoon, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family dominated by a marketing, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong. It was power.
It was the last word in all discussions in the family.
She started a lot of the documents in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia about 1840.
She was born about 1880 and his experience with slavery as I saw the world.
She was hard, but he was also love.
When I was little, and I looked at it, she came up with me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe, and then I was soldiers.
One or two hours later, I went back to looking at it, and I came up and said, "Remark, still feel my pigeon?
And if he said no, he grabbed me again, and if he said yes, he left me in peace.
He had this human quality that made you always want to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of the 10.
In occasions, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture your time and attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all of my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At the beginning, I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her and she smiles, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up the room, and he took me out of her hand and said, "Come Brahmer. They're going to be converting."
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
And he took me outside and said, "Brain will tell you something, but you can't say to it."
I said, "Okay, May.
She said, "Now thank you not to do it." I said, "Sure."
Then she sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been looking at you."
And he said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do whatever you want."
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to promise three things, Brand" ...
I said, "See, May.
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
He said, "She is my son, and you have to promise you that you'll always be carefully.
As I loved my mom, I said, "Yes, May, I'll do it."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing when the right thing is hard.
And I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, May. So I'll do."
Then finally said, "The third thing I want you to do is you never drink alcohol.
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yeah, Mom, I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a brother a bigger year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six beers package, I don't know where I took them, I would grab my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got to the crazy surgeons.
He took a beer shark, offered her sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. Okay.
My brother said, "Come on. Today we do it. And you always do the same thing as we are.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can follow.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens to you? Take a tears?"
I was looking at it with force and I went on, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with Mahatma.
And I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, "Mary tells all the grandchildren that are special.
I was desperately.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be spreading away.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken an alcohol.
I don't say this is a virtue, I say it for the power that identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the other people who really don't look at it.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been ready during the protection.
My uncle died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be committed.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate.
We have seven million people in everyday freedom.
And this massive incarceration, in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, it finds so much, so much, so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three blacks between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or in a conditional freedom.
In urban communities across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, of 50 to 60 percent of all color young people are in jail or in a conditional freedom.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not guilty.
And it seems like we feel very cool.
The policy of fear and the fluid makes us believe that these are not problems.
We're disconnected.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in some pretty curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you send yourself from rights forever, if you have a criminal condition.
Right now in Alabama, 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as elevated as it was before they passed the law from the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where you feel 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without able to go out again.
Right now we are in the process of some literatures.
The only country in the world.
I represent people in the death row.
This death penalty issue is interesting.
In a sense, have you been trying to think that the final question is, people deserve dying for the crimes committed?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another way to look at it, it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes committed to, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine people executed -- one which is innocent that it's extracted and released from the death of death.
A error rate -- amazing, an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never allow you to put airplanes if every nine that would take, you would be a star start.
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I talk to you about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and it lasted to World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by the terror.
In many communities, people were afraid of being thrown away.
They worried to be bombarded to them.
The terror threat was what he defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say talks -- you make speeches -- you can tell people you stop saying that in our history we were dealing with the terrorism, after 1181?
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism continued to, obviously, with segregated and decades of racial submarines and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we collide with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about race. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial sexuality without the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about the death penalty plane.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's well worrying about what you say."
He said, "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We can naturally never have it here."
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and deliberately we were going to run people."
Think about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would run people, especially if they are in their majority of Jews: Jesus.
We could not tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect there.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these very difficult issues, positive and wonderful things are, yet implicitly.
We love innovation.
We dislike technology. We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately those realities are driven by suffering, abuse, degradation, marginality.
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
We just talked about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spend more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the lasts, which will never get to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
That's how we are. Despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from food ideas also by the heart media.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us not only in the bright and dense but also the dark and how hard it is.
Valcement Hama, the great gender leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering, we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in spores of despair and being testing?
Well, that orientation for spirit is virtually in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be committed.
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to exclusion, to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's go back to them.
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa Parks to meet Rosa Parks.
These women are just gathered to talk.
Occasionally, the lady Carl called me to say, "Brain comes to me -- the Mrs. Parks coming. We're going to gather to talk.
Do you want to come up and listen to it?
I said, "I know lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?
I said, "Let's listen to you."
So I went and just listened to them.
It was very visual, very implantating.
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now Brand, Brenday -- I'm going to tell me that this idea of equality.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted uncomfortable.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice.
We try to end up with life senses, without parole.
We try to do something about the death penalty thing.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the mass including?
I gave all of my best speech, and then I looked at me and he said, "I member my member member."
And he said, "To you the "great, very helpful.
At that time, Mrs. Carrie leaned up, he put my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very, very valuable."
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to figure out how to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst thing we've ever made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not that it's a barrier.
Even if somebody kills another, it is not that it's a murderer of it.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not what it is.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic -- very beautiful, very implantating, is not being judged by our technology, by our designs.
In the end, you judge the character of a society, not the way they treat rich, powerful and privileged people, but the way they treat poor people, conductives and prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I am occasionally wrong at all. I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
I get tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been sitting with a lot of disastrous.
I go to jail and see my customers from 13 and 14 years, which have been trained for them to judge as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge become somebody who is not it?
The judge was characterized as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night I was wake up thinking -- for God, if judge can become something you don't are, should have magical powers.
Yes, Brahway, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think about it, but I started working on a model.
I had a 14 year-old customer -- a little, poor, black.
I started working on the doctor, with a funding that said, "Motion so that my 14-year-old black customer is treated as a 75-year-old privileged white client.
And in the muscle, I put that there was been informed behavior in action, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an adverse line about how in this country there is no ethics but a whole lack of ethics.
And the next morning I woke up thinking that insulin muscle would be a dream, or did I really write it?
For my horror, not only had it reduced, but he had sent it to the court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally decided -- oh God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case.
I got up to the car and felt really abundant, overwhelmed.
I went into the car to the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and penish.
I finally pulled out of the car. I walked to the court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a older black man -- it was the construction of the court.
When I saw me, he came to me and said, "Who's you?"
I said, "I'm a prototype." He replied, "Is you a boomeria?" I said yes.
So I went out and stripped me.
And I whispered myself in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was visible.
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this habitat motor?
I said, "I know Mr. I was me, and we started discussing it.
People started coming in. Everyone was involved.
I was the one who had written those madness.
The cops came to the professionals assembled, the autonomics.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everyone fluids, because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the range of the eye I got up to see the realization that it was and came.
He was looking at the window and he had been able to hear all that crime.
I kept walking down here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with the face of concern -- walked in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge decided a receptor.
During the deception of the deception of the alternative was offered because the consensus had entered the room.
The assistant was released on the old black.
And he said, "Jim, what do you do in the audience room.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at the assistant, he looked at me and said, "I went to this audience room to tell this young man who keeps her view in the goal with the strength."
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We cannot be truly human evolved if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and entertainment and creativity must be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to fragility, compassion and justice.
And on top of all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with feet.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious wish of the audience, from this community, to help in your purpose, to do something.
Something that's not a crash. What can we do?
BF: There are several different opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a reform this spring in which an effort will be done to restore the funds that are spent today.
For example, here in California, it's going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty over the next five years.
And despite this, 45 percent of the cases of homicide are not concluded in artists.
56 percent of rapes don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This referendum is going to propose that these funds are destroyed to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's said that it has to do with the highest rate of including.
What would you tell you to think that is this?
SS: Actually, the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase is in the coastal population.
And we let us convince the punishment of the punishment.
We have three legal causes in order to bring people out of perpetual chain, for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against property instead of making those resources into their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of criminals and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Broadway, you have excited.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter Diamonds? These are just some of the clips that I got over the last six months -- they could barely be the last six days or of the last six years.
The idea is that the press media wants to provide negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day, our senses get much more data than probably the brain can process it.
And as nothing else matters to survive, the first side of all that data is an ancient fragment of temporal lobe called ambulance.
Amazon is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
He ordered and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So a dozen stories we will prefer to look at negative.
That old man came from the press, "If there's blood, sell, it's very true.
And because all digital devices provide negative news seven days in the week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising that we are pesticides.
It doesn't surprise that people think that the world goes wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Perhaps in change, what really happens is that we get distributions.
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problem: climate change, the expansion of species, the shortage of water and energy, certainly we have them.
As human beings are very good at avoiding the problems, and in the long level, we end up with them.
So let's look at it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life is more than doubled, the average income per capita per capita has tripled around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, the cost of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy that global literacy happened from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to put up more and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, redesigned, television and air conditioning and cars.
The magnetic bases of the last century, the planets on the planet, would never have dreamed of such luxury.
So supporting a lot of this is technology and lately its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that brings in the information technology in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cell phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and thousands of times faster than a super-edge superconductor.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, how it is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession and depression and in touch.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any big challenges.
And although it's graduated on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And in this curve, to Moore's Law heroism, there are a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of Autoshice called infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuel, vaccines and food, digital medicine, nanotechnology and A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on Watson of Watson, of IBM?
It was pit.
I looked for the best headline that there would be.
And I loved this one: Watson comes to human opportunities?
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the materials of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everybody in the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, launched a new university called Singapore University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we ask them to launch a company, or a product or service that can possibly affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have sounded absurd.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating luxury life for every single person on the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that's scarce, and it's going to go back to it.
You see, scarce is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon 17th in the middle of 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited the king of Silicon.
Napoleon troops ate with silver covers, and the same Napoli, with gold.
But the king of Silicon, I ate the aluminum covers.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, value more than gold and platform.
And so the tip of the Monster to Washington is a aluminum of aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is eight percent of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's linked by oxygen and silences.
But then the electronics came and made the aluminum so cheap that we used it as desperately desperate.
We projected this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet based for 5,000 times more energy than we used in a year.
They get to Earth 16 terabytes of energy every 18 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's about accessible.
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the general general people, eight rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, the solar electricity costs six cents the tile per hour compared to the 15 cents of national media.
And if we have an abundance of energy too, we have water abundance too.
Let's talk now about the water in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager Spain to the Earth, in 1990, after Saturn.
I took a famous picture. How was it called?
"A little blue dot paint.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent of water.
Yes, 97 percent is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight for the water of the planet, but here's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
The nanotechnology comes, the nature.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the beaten -- I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to do it, he gave me permission to do it, his technology called Selian -- maybe known -- is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to any water source, salary, contaminated water, a law for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coke just agreed to make an important test of these units in the developing world.
If that's going out well, and I have full confidence to be, Coke will implement it in 200 countries on the planet.
This is a innovative innovation for this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world by the end of 2013.
Think about it, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information and communications and no one could have ever predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- PGano video, images, images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology -- now they develop and lose market value with mobile phones.
Perhaps the best can get to when the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the California Foundation -- something called the X-ray X Brazil, 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world so that they combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has A.I. they can take, they can get blood blood.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the moral charge is 25 percent of the health care worker.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that doesn't recognize it, to call the health of health and, first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce an abundance world.
I call it the billion in increase.
The white lines here are population.
We've just passed the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never ever heard of global conversation.
What would these people?
What are you going to do? What do you want to do?
And instead of an economic collapse we'll have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in the global economy.
And more health to the Marchelash, from a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computing in the cloud, will be more productive than ever before.
What can it provide us three billion more members of humanity, and educated healthy and productive health?
What about a few voices you never heard before.
What if we give the oppressed.
What will these three billion you?
What if they are contributions that we can't predict?
Something that I learned with the X Prize is that small teams -- guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things, things that only could do the big corporations and governments before.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called Phoenix.
He was at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine structure and function.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a computer problem.
They've played these college teachers, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people were joined and started to play it.
And it's shown that today, the recognition of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the beat.
We have the capital of the technology.
And we have three billion new minds that will be used to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a couple of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
Part of the point of party.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, I will give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1883.
You might believe that it would be personalized, but it wasn't like that.
It actually collects fish.
And he described one of them as a very common.
It was the beginning.
And it was a lot of time to the 1880s.
Now the fish is on the Red AIDS list.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're prison.
The floors still say they follow intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in 1971.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate me.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The laughter was surrounded by palm and as you can see, from a few mangroves.
There were the talents of about 20 inches -- the black clay illusion.
And the fishing of this thylacine was very abundant and happened for a good moment, so it won more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had gone in half.
They made five inches married.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was happy in the introduction of the emergency fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s of the 1970s.
Fish development was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 fishermen imposing industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly was called Marshall 4.
I went out to fishing on it, and we did studies in South China Sea in the South China and especially in the Sam Sea.
What we captured was a sensitive thing.
We capture, now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were specialists, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny blobs about a few other remains that are coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was raining.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background goes from being a solid coral background, in this case, to be a logo.
This is a dead tumor.
They didn't eat them. They were declined because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
I still wasn't shown.
So they wanted to kill it, because it was a good food.
This mountain of rest is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it doesn't have a document.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of party, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this happens something like this.
On the axis and we have good things: biodiversity, lots of choirs, the laugh of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Every generation uses the images of the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extraordinary forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the rise of changes.
And at the end of the end of keeping a little bit of respects.
And that, in big measure, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before you get extinct, is unconsciously.
You don't lose an abundant animals.
You lose little awesome animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big loss.
Over time, we focused on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become little frequent because we fish them.
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of party.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, a lot of scientists, to question that it was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some people think, like you can catch such and as you can see a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, generally don't use the science scientists using it, because it's not science."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in instructional societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role that can be a protected marine zone.
Because with the protected marine areas, we really remember the past.
We remember the past that people can't conceive because the point of point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that it provides -- which allows them to erase their point of participation.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access to, like the Middle West, for example?
I think there is art and cinema -- maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Charachure Bay Scot.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Cheetoashi Bay, 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that mathematics and totality are like "Alishe] are like "Awarding."
And if you think about "Awarding," if you think about why people got together with the movie -- without talking about the story of Pacific -- why do we get to get the images?
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my recommendation -- the only one I'm going to give, is Cambridge, make "Alley Iraq.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Alabam, the YouTube trend manager -- and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today we will see why videos make viral and how important it is.
We all want to be stars, celebrations, singers -- when I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the website makes any of us, or our actions, copper companies in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a sandwich.
They climb up over 48 hours of YouTube per minute.
And of those, only a little percentage is made viral -- it gets infinite and conversation and cultural momentum.
How does that happen?
Three things: trend creators and surprise community and surprise factor.
Well, let's start with.
Bern Verizonic, "Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
Oh, wow.
KA: Last year, Ben Verman published this video clip outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows the reproductions in the population of the past summer.
Beautiful doesn't make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you're called Yourn Mountain Bern.
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Zimbabwe.
Jimmy Member published this toy that would categorize the video to the population.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Member presents us new and interesting things and giving them a broader audience.
Rebelli Blackberry:  It's Friday -- you have to start Friday on the weekend.   You all want to get the weekend.    Views, Friday starting Friday Vering.  KA: You won't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
"See, Red Blackberge is one of the most popular videos in the year.
They saw almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Like Archie go down, this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday -- it's true.
And if you ask about those other peaks -- they are also Friday, too.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday sad?
Well, I took it Tory -- and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson by Mister Science Theater was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends of trends adopt a point of view, and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 parasites of "Mastery on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every one of the other days.
Unlike the unique entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon by constructing it or doing something new with it.
Nine Cat is a repetitive animation with a music speech.
So, that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three hours that has been seen four million times.
The cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats looking at the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet technology community.
There were records.
Somebody did a version of ancient people.
And then it became international in it.
Suddenly, a whole community came out of the mix that made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate today.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted Arab and double, or Rebelli Blail or Nine Catholic: Nicologent.
What would you have written to do that constantly construct?
In a world where two days of video per minute, only that really unique and unexpected can be done in the way that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy who protest against the multiple cycles in New York, I admit that I don't care too much.
Casey Stone must be moved by non-violence for biology, but often there are obstacles that are pushing you directly through the bicycle.
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and their humor, Casey Nike made five million see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth for everything that we do creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
Bern Verigralistan, what does this mean?
Whoa.
KA: What does this mean?
Tree creators of trend, creative communities of participation -- totally unexpected, are characteristics of new kinds of media -- a new culture, to which we all have access and is the audience that defines the population.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Bible, started on YouTube.
They didn't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little bit owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media, it's barely the current media, but define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still broken.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece, a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a playwright, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
Imagine that as the communications come into the Canada, the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, now they were transported.
It was refugeed in silence.
He died from history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget her story.
My task was not to let that have been in vain and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to stand up, but we supported it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat on a boat by going through the sea.
My mother, May, was just 18 years old when her father died, and a concerned marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had gone down to a traditional task, the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was incredible for her who couldn't do it.
And then from a four years of fourth years that defies fiction, a boat was shifted into the secondary sea of fish based.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the pirate and the rape and the death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a fragment with poison.
If we were captured, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the proper standing on every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were hooked up with the value of men in our boat, or the engine dying, and I can't break off for six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men's men.
No apple had the same flavor later.
After three months in a refugee camp, we were running in Melena.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in Fortune, a working-class suburb whose population is composed of immigrants in the world.
Unlike middle class suburbs whose existence I discovered, in Fortune, had no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the French English fragments were traded between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farmers, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT security.
We were poor.
All the dollars were associated, and they established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what you should take, which was usually new clothes, was always a second hand.
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the beaches, because I had to last six years.
And there were weird and painful singing on the fairly short eyes, and some graduation, "Asians, go home."
How, what?
Something in me was served.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to survive them."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted, every night, but we told us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered nightmares all of the boat.
And my task was to be wake up until his nightmare started to be able to wake it out.
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be strategies and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and influence, and trade-up children trapped between two worlds.
subsidies and passions.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, including what I demand for myself.
In the other, I was locked up in precise lives, tragic limited by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer, I was elected by the year Australia of the year.
And I was catched from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit up.
So Lee, the anonymous resident of Fortune, was now so Leo, refugees and social activist, invited to speak in sites that I had never heard about, and in houses whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to get to the routine and the comfort of life in an effective suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, counting about the day of each one and getting asleep, three in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when we got into the ship.
He had never been an option.
"He said, "Hey, and don't be what you're not."
So I talked about juvenile description and education and design and destructions.
And the more frankly, the more frankly, the more I was asked to speak.
I met people from all walks in life, many of them doing what they loved -- living in the frontier of the possible.
And although I ended up my license, I realized I couldn't stay in a armor career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that's okay to be a unknown, a newly new one, new on the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean collapsing the horizon, it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your property.
I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is destroyed, but not the way we eat.
possibilities that would not have been allowed to be allowed by tremendously self-destructive.
There was an energy there, an implantational optimism, a rare mixture of humility and value.
So I kept my intuition.
I put together a little group of people for whom the slogan can't do was an amazing challenge.
For a year, we didn't have a cents.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup that we all share.
We worked up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
After a single trip.
My hearts again.
Three months later, I had moved, and the adventure continued to continue.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the Configuration was the social norm and the local Maria was the person who matters.
Life didn't change for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it alone.
At the age of 17, he became a connection of a Mayan whose mother beat her.
No support of his husband, caused a review to the sue and taking the cause itself, and much more back when it won.
He can't make it show to be wrong.
He was on the shower in the room of a hotel in Sydney when she died, 1,000 miles, in Melanity.
He looked through the shadow of the shower and saw it standing on the other side.
I knew that I had come to be able to go.
My mother called minutes later.
And days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Fortune and we sat around his backyard.
We told her stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the atmosphere.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monkey, "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold, so cold, so cold, so cold.
"Because you've taken your hand from the tomorrow."
"You haven't sold it."
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life formed us, now we can see that the men who had come to our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could want that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of how easy it is from the right.
Can I give you a place in your lives, diving it brave in every wave -- the impressive rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them, I would do it.
Trade Nelson and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in Ragger about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the star start, with the Sufi singer sun Swarth.
We were talking about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian epidemic.
In those days when Indians wanted to travel up, we jumped into a car and we climbed the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I arrived, the great Indian warrior, I had silk, pulled a bow and a arrow on the ground, got water.
Now we do the same with streets and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced magic.
And that was a lot of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more temperature.
I was terrified of this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to not kill it.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pilot silver close.
And this particular piece of 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, and pirate and barrelia in my imagination.
And I had the sense that mobile phones and luxury clock and camera prevent that we do.
They face our inspiration.
And so I launched myself to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing it.
I illustrate books since age 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device of connecting the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, the animation, the sound and the touch.
The narrative becomes more and more multi-touch.
But what does that look like?
I'm about to launch Khali, an interactive app for iPad.
He says, "Take your fingers on every light.
And so --  He says, "This box belongs to -- I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
So at several times I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons but to that childhood magic -- those ideas that we judge from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always became exciting to me.
So, over here, we have to include the iPad to release fireflies to free.
And actually light up your way into what it comes from the book.
Another idea that fascinated me as a child was that a whole galaxy was held in a battle.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a bag that I drag into this magical device, within the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book there have always been maps, but they have been static maps.
This is a map that grows up, flute and guide.
In certain points of the book also reveals it.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and at the same time.
These from here are the operations.
We've all heard of the fairies and the news, but how many people outside India know their Indian counterparts -- they would take them up?
These poor people have been trapped in the cameras of India during millennia, in an old and a little book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary childhood story.
In a story that deals current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been locked up, attached to their P.C. -- haven't gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out to the outside or take the camera or the iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of colleagues, from steps, stones, guilt and cooks.
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter take a picture of a flower and then tag it.
In another chapter you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then tag it.
So you create a digital collection of pictures that you can put on the Web.
A kid from London puts a picture of a dog and says, "Oh, I saw a dog."
A kid in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the market variations between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video started and actually increase a group of animated debris that appear on the inside of the house.
At a time, the screen is full of leaves at a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and blow them together so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where nature forces are intertwined with technology and magic and technology on one another.
We take the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic and joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why a lot of healthy projects fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of the Roden University was to take a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she had a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and met, what happens?
"How can we help it?
And we tend to think, this is one of the biggest problems for what everybody or maybe not all, but most of the health projects fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi school. It's a very simple thing.
He has a little bit of a little bit of a store and off.
Every morning I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 K.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect me, sends my information to Google Health.
And my head doctor has access to him as well. So, he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when he needs a coral assistance or some urgency of that style but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So, every morning I connect me to my Wi-Fi school and before I get up to my car, people start to talk to me, Light today, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people out of their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, it will be available.
This little battle connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people can, from their homes, take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they go back to recover control and be captain of their own boat, but it can also help us to the health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of medical attention, the dopamine of demand and other issues.
To make techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through crowds.
And one of the things that we did want to share with you with you with a video.
We all have navigation control in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM ATM is in Mathemator.
Also where all the gas is.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest DARPA to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody knew that.
Nobody knew where to get the DARPA saved lives right now.
So what we did was we made crowds in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to say, you see a DARPA, please see it, tell me where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up on office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 DEWAras was already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an iPad.
We created an app for Larvae, augmented reality, to find these DNA these DNA.
And every time they are in the city of Mahar and someone collapsed, they can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest DRS, which can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this one, not just like DARPA CO2, which is the name of the product, but also like CAA.
And we want to start to start it globally.
We're looking at all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, to work and act as a center for the crowd of the DNA around the world.
Every time they are on vacation and someone collapses, it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DNA.
It could be message services or phone people, for example, to see if the DARPA who shows is still in its place.
Please let me do this and not only improve health but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it the photography, is it?
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my passion before the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the prostate.
For me, photography had more than to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the project.
pictures like this: a construction on a very frightening road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite that, it keeps a level of realism to it.
Or pictures like these -- dark and colorful in the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of realism.
And when I say reflective I say photographer.
Because, of course, it's not something that can capture but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
Photos where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that will capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
Are you the details or the colors.
Try the light?
What does the illusion create illustration?
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world, and how you can perceive on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginary objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems three-dimensional -- as if it was.
But at the same time, we know that there is no exist.
So we deceive the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It really is combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem real, I think they're those where we don't even think about the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But by combining pictures is very important to consider it, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, combined pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are filled with these requirements, they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of different images with a perfect joint.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
This is another example.
It might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is manipulated.
But this image is completely composed by photographs of different places.
And so I think it's easier to create a place than finding it, because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The costs are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit of stone.
And yes, I even made the top of the top of the island so that it looks more Sweden.
So to make a realistic outcome I think it takes planning to happen.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well thought.
If you do a good job when you take the pictures, the result can be very beautiful, and at the same time you really do.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it.
It's a diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of Riosee microorganisms, versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this is like a lot of others that we tend to see, is kind of a straight line on logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
Talk about self-expression technology is a novel thing.
Here's something weird here.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn up the lights.
I would need more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we chart technological curves in logarithmic scales, lighting scales?
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where you say, this is the years, or a whole unit of time, and this would be any measure of technology that I'd like to grab, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't say much.
But if I thank you, for example, some other technology, like transport, in a smartphone curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it's a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology will move as fast as microbes past, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't advance that rhythm.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of the technological growth that every few years move orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to do is -- looking at these exponential curves -- we see that they don't go forever.
It's not possible to sustain this shift as fast as it goes.
It will happen one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve -- I know like this until you add something completely different, or maybe do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
And we would be in the middle of a transition now.
In this line, we're in a transition of what used to be the world, a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way that adapts the world?
How new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're embedded in it.
I remember that as a child, the future happened in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been found, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is happening.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all going to be so different than to extrapolate what we're doing today makes no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we experience.
But to do that, I will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with many chemicals that float around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals are organized us, we give an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and it is that, at that time, had been floating a few oil droplet with all sorts of chemical recipes inside its inside.
Some of those oil blobs contain a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate from the outside and the drops grew up.
And they started divided.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil guys.
But those blobs were not alive, in the current sense, because each one contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they divide a distributed distribution of the chemicals that they continue.
So every single speaker was a little different.
In fact, the blobs that somehow became better than the time to incorporate the surrounding chemicals -- they grow more more chemicals and divide more.
Usually they lived longer, they were more represented out.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things became interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways that we don't understand very well these golden guys learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they worked on this meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to replicate it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since they evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun -- we can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 microbes of white dust that I try to hide for people in safety.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this DNA fragments, and I amplify it 10 to the 22 times.
And so if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of for all the present, in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a classroom that would have put it in a virus, and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step.
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then another great step happened when things were very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information by forming the cells of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and put them together to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistance to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave a place that they would form communities that, in a way, were together in that, and they set up a smile.
And so they survive or they failed together, or if a community was very successful -- all the individuals in that community were replicated more and farmed by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe in the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have multicellular communities, communities of many different kinds of cells working together like a single organism.
In fact, we are a multicellular community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles, or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started to absorb information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to record, to understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learning not to eat a certain fruit, because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that would have been learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system builds those information structures really accelerate evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most refined version of the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a vague idea, in your head.
I'm sitting here by emitting a few grandmothers, and hopefully building a similar idea, value and confusing, in your heads that I kept certain analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated, we converted it into sound, in sound sequences and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started to make abstract.
Now we go through periods of similar periods to multicellular organisms -- we abstract our methods of record, presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The phone, the computing tape, the CPUs, and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that leads to something much larger, faster and capable of evolving more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microbes.
They already saw the evolutionary example of You where I produced some evolution with the Convention program, before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next one, the language -- took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take only a few decades.
The process is retreating, I guess autonomy is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more change, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion explosion.
We see the process retreats.
But I make my life by designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I jobs to design them would not be possible without recent IT advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of The Tanzania Maccares, we think about a level of abstraction -- we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that you could before you couldn't get much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microscopes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please compute, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions of anthropologists.
Could you run these sequences of instructions to random, to run all those programs, and take those who more approximate to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So, we find the programs that are more about to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them succeeded.
But one, luckily, could get two numbers in the right order.
And I said, computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task?
We get those and put them up to the rest of them.
And now we play the best numbers of the numbers.
And we go back to them by following a process of reconciliating analog to sex.
Let's take two programs that are going to add children, which are interpreting surgeons, and children inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of products from the combination of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the process."
I qualify again.
It introduces some mutations.
And it tries again and it tries to do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that order the number absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs that I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they make the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that you get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depended on it.
I once went in a 747 with Marko Missing and he pulled a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, "This airplane has hundreds of thousands of participants working together to offer a safe flight, doesn't make you feel a slice?
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering does.
Yet we don't understand the whole choice that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, and so we can execute these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's broken.
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so confusing.
Because all these technologies are beating.
We're sticking.
And we're at an analog moment to the level of single-celled organisms when they became multiple molecules.
We are the ambulances, and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part to think that we're the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes the lunch and I think it will stop here before I was eliminating.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that should change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've practiced enough time to let me get a part of my false prison on that.
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little baseball a little bit.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about to go out of "Raption the rules and talk about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know it.
It's called the battery.
And we talked about 300 of a battery that bat 300 of them.
That means that basis effectively, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the game field without being transformed, and anybody who's trying to launch it to the first base doesn't get to time, and the second foundation will be saved.
Three attempts of 10.
Do you know how you call a 300 battery battery in the Grand Light?
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
Do you know how you call a block battle?
By the way, that is someone that from 10 hits -- it's going to be four.
Lego -- like Ted Williams legislation, the last player of the Big League Lake to run more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's move this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have approaches and they're blessed to a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in the speech.
That doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a loved one has two courteners observed and their family doctor led to a cardiologist whose record in anti-police is 200 dollars.
But do you know something?
She's just improving this year.
And their ideas have been 275.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think that should be the average of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon, a nurse or a genocide observation?
1,000 very good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the attention of a good surgeon, a doctor or a paradigm.
What we do, though, is to send them into the world, and it includes me with the death of being perfect.
That never, you know, make a mistake and worry about figuring out how to do it right.
That was the message that I absorbed when I was in medical school.
I was a comparison annoying student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Golden studied until a blood test.
Like that.
I studied in my little department, in the resident of the General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything of memory.
From my kind of anatomy -- I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the air, the diagnosis frequency and the non-violent discrete.
And I even knew the digital diagnosis about how to classify kidney tuberculosis skills.
And the more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with honor.
And I went from medical school with the impression that if you memorize everything, then I would know everything, or the most possible, close to all, because this is how I'm going to be involved with mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mr. Drug.
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the Mr. Dropping to the emergency service where I was working.
At that time, I was assigned to the cartoon service.
And when I was an emergency I had to get to a cardiologist, I was able to attend that patient.
It will report the chief chief of residents.
When I saw Mr. Dr. I was driving.
I heard a self-replicating sound.
And when I answered it, I heard a broken sound on both sides, which gave me a confusing cardiac failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pumping blood forward, blood goes to lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose it.
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would give him.
He gave him assistant and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
I gave it distributed, water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that was when he made the first mistake, sent her home.
It actually made two more errors.
He sent her to his house without talking to the chief chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and build it with him to see her.
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to provide complementary information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Perhaps I didn't want to be a resident that would require constant attention.
Perhaps I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking responsibility, that I could take care of my patients without even hiring my boss to me.
The second mistake I made was worse.
By sending it to his house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner inside that said, "Gold," it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse to take the Morgen Christmas -- "Do you think it's okay if you go home?
And the nurse thought and then said with total nature, "Yeah, I think it's going to be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high, and the ambulance along with the parasites took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, had a bad presentation in the stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I started to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking where my car was to go home. At that point, I did something that I don't normally do it.
I went through the emergency service service at home.
And there another nurse, not the one that I took from Mr. Drug before, but another one. I told me three words, those three words that most emergency physicians are afraid of.
Other specialists fear them too, but there is a particular in emergency and that is that we see the patients.
The three words are: Do you?
"Did you remember the patient who sent his home?"
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"Well, she returned, with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But he went back and on the edge of death.
At the end of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called 9/11, the paradigm brought it into emergency with an artificial pressure from Han, which means a severe shock.
I barely breathe, and I was blue.
The emergency staff took all their resources.
They gave him medicine to raise artificial pressure.
And they put an artificial breath.
I was excited and rocked to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after it would stabilize it, he was in intensive therapy and hoped against all hope he would recover.
And in the two or three days it was obvious that I would never expect.
He had an irreversible brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, what was going on.
And in the ninth day, they let her go. The lady Dr. Dream, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say that they never forget the names of which they die.
That was my first experience.
The next week, I was punished by it and I experienced for the first time the evil shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated, without feeling that healthy shame, because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the patterns and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves an teaching.
The evil shame that I'm talking about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did is that we were wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt that.
And it wasn't for my boss, he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I smiled things and make sure that they wouldn't hurt me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss, why was he sent to his house?
And in my worst moments, why did I make a mistake so stop?
Why did I choose medicine?
Bit that feeling was disappeared.
And I started feeling better.
And in a cloudy day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I picked up the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And so it was.
I went back to work.
But he went back to happen.
Two years later, it was helping in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy and approved.
He was sitting here.
I looked on his throat -- I was a little color.
He emailed him penicillin and sent him to his house.
But as he ran to the door he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my change change, my boss was asked to talk to me usually in his office.
And I got the three words: Do you remember you?"
Remember the patient that I saw by a pain in the garage?
Well, he came back and didn't have a strategic farmers.
He had a potentially deadly approach called exploities.
You can find it in Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but from the top area, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He lost, fortunately, didn't fail.
You get antibiotics that are going to be interested and recovered by a few days.
And then you go through the same period of shame and reports, then I went back and I went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same set of urgency.
And it's a great endeavor, especially working in a hospital, because it goes to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a discovery.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
He ordered a kidneys, but it turned out normal. A colleague that was reviewing the patient perceived a certain sensitivity on the lower right and called the surgeon.
The other patient was very diarrhea.
He ordered him liquid to resist and asked my colleague to review it.
I checked it up and I noticed some sensitivity on the bottom right, called the surgeon.
They were both operated and recovered well.
But every case was struggled to me, I was deployed.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a beat.
The most significant ones have been for the last five years.
Just embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't release me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues.
How do you teach them so that they don't make the same errors.
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure, from failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you won't listen to someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a translation in my hospital made the wrong leg -- believe me that it would have difficulty to look at it in the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions -- the ones that make mistakes and the ones that they can't sleep, and the ones who have a lot of results and ones that have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we take away from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal health study and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Star Stan to my program, "What Chicago Coat, Black Art: (Allowing white, black art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are unbelievable.
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in every 10 drugs prescribed in the hospital are wrong, or deforestation is not right. In a system that intricational infection is getting more and more numerous and more numerous and more numerous and death.
In this country, 24,000 Canadian candidates for preventable.
the U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's about blue substances, because we're not depending on the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A hospital system where knowledge, every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
The distribution of sleep invaded everything.
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on the chest, it comes up with blue eyes and with alcohol and all of a sudden my story is about advanced.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot. I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't relate their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were taught us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals on error -- well, it's not going to be anybody.
And what about how people don't want to talk about their more serious cases.
In my program, "Diano white, black art -- is already a habit saying, "This is my worst mistake. I would tell everybody, from the parasites to the head of heart surgery -- "This is my worst mistake, blah, blah blah blah -- "What are your mistakes? And I would run the microphone into them.
And their students would stop, they would go back, they would go down the head and swallow out and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake.
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a redesigning medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The redesigning physician is human, you know, human -- it accepts it, and it doesn't get proud of its mistakes, but it gets effort to learn from what happened to teach others.
I share your experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
And so the errors of other people are not with the intention of catching them, but in a very loving way and support for everyone to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system, and when this happens, they make errors of time when it happens, errors are made of time when it happens, and they make errors in time.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I'm a rededer doctor.
I'm a human, I eat mistakes.
And I feel a lot, but I'm effort to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick up an average American, is about 70 a day.
Not a long way ago in a research followed for a week to a group of companies of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that were used by these executives and the time they employed in making related decisions.
They found that on average, they get 130 jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of mindsets.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the nine minutes, and how many of you at an hour.
How do you grade the way that you handle those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of the time, to choose to the shock of options.
I want to talk about the problem and a lot of possible solutions.
And as I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a palm.
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of options of options?
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I recorded this very, very high level supermarket, at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called Drazies.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and video, more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water embarrassed -- and this was when we took water water.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I wondered, why never buy nothing?
This is the source of the olive oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in the sealed box that came from millennial trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and ask him, "Did you work well this strategy of offering all these choices?
He pointed to me the full buses of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the magnetics.
Passed.
They had 380 different classes.
We installed a post to say, right at the entrance of the store.
We put out of six same sandwiches, or about 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop the memorial to test the memory?
More people stopped when there were 24, 60 percent, than when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a market task.
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were 24, only three percent came to buy memorial.
Of those who stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought dramatically.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy if they found six, which if they found 24 than if they found 24.
Well, deciding that we don't really buy a lot of it probably makes us -- at least it's good to preserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of choice overload affects us in very momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't convince us.
Now the issue of the day, financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with Guar Henry, and Emit Kamical and Web Jane, where we saw the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding supply available in savings for retirement plans, the 404 program, described people to save for the future.
And we found that actually there was a correlation of it.
We had 65 plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding offered there was less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation described to the 60 percent.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those of you who decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, the more people were interdependent to avoid the actions or the investment funds.
When there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we will remember to optimize future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences of offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they pay the decision, that they apply it even when this goes against the interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less satisfying things, even though they get better.
The main reason is that we manage to look at that giant variation of massive, mustard and vigilant and magnetic but we are not able to do the calculations to compare and contrast and choose that awesome exhibition of it.
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've tried, in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, Cortex.
They've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People always bother when I say, "Contrast."
They worry about losing space in the corner.
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange reductions -- there will be an increase in the sales -- you'll go down the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When Project & Gamble went from 26 different types of Health & Shelf to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Goldman Catholic Corporation eliminated the products for cats that are less selected, they increased the uses at 87 percent, for two causes, higher sales and fewer costs.
It knows that supermarkets, in average today, they offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest stores in the world today is Alexandra and it provides only 1,400 products, a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to run the choices is the plant of David Languagues, the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically constrained to a life insurance fund.
People who really want to choose, are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to cut down.
They're all important options.
The first thing I do is ask employees -- "Tell me the differences that are among those choices.
And if your employees can't difference, you will not be able to do your customers either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with Gary.
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience to this audience with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description here.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give you a applause.
(Music little little little little little little balls. Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the supply.
Aren't it?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I actually got more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round than in the second corner, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the operation of choices, which is Congress.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and the consequences must be felt very vividly -- very concerned in a very concrete.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use effective?
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Lake Benjamin and Alexander President, about NASA people who worked at IIIIIn -- these people were in a meeting where they were affecting a 404 plan.
To that meeting, that we built exactly how it was used -- we did a little addiction.
What we added was we asked the staff to think about positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this minute, there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts of four.
The third technique is Classic.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine passenger.
We saw that in the Benjamin supermarkets along the north row, magazines can contain from 330 different types to 660 different types.
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to tell you.
These are two jewelry explorations.
One is called "Japan," and the other, "Singapore."
If you think the one on the left is Switzerland, and the one on the right is Japan, you get a palm.
(Let's -- the little little little little little battles.
If you think the one on the left is Japan and the one on the right is Switzerland, you get a palm.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Japan and the one on the right is Switzerland. But you know something?
This science scheme is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something to who they pick up, not that defined them.
And you often see this problem with these enormous funding lists.
So who are they informed?
My fourth category contains complexity.
We can make a lot more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very complicated decision, buy it a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows you to persuade it completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to raise your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that each one offers each one.
colors, outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
Motor, changes of change, four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order where decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four boxes, at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look like?
How much involved.
If you are always playing the button in every decision, this indicates that you're open, or be: you're losing them.
We find that the ones who go from many options to a few operations, they push the button for identity over and over again, and more.
We lose them.
If you go from a few options to many, you keep there.
Same information, same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order where information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn how to pick up.
Even though I choose the box of change -- I don't say anything about the preferences of the inner democracy, in any ways we are prepared to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now makes us more considered with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of option support, Cortex, eliminating strange alternatives. Consider, making it real. Classically, we can handle more categories with less choices with less options.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help handle the alternatives or better for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who serve.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of an election is being careful when you choose to.
And the more careful we are in our better choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in Eastern Eastern Germany, if you had a typewriter to write it to the government.
You had to record a piece of writing text with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of text.
If you found a writer with the wrong message you could trace the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we didn't know that somebody could do this, how much it would limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturing and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots on each page that makes them a pattern that makes them out of one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to get a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you see what happens in the online world, we can grab the attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
There are the circuits.
like Mr. Diagnosity Gulf from Kingdom in Ukraine.
The cybercriminals of the cybercriminals is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, including numbers.
There are really many cases of online millions, multiple, who won money with their attacks.
This is Vilability Titanic, from Tanzania, Starbook.
This is Alfred Golden.
This is Stephen Water.
This is Berlin Southern.
This is Matthew Anderson: Tarania Alanian and so on, etc.
These guys do their online fortunes, but they do it by illegal media through bank tropics to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The secret service in the United States, two months ago, freeze the Swiss account of this lady, Sam Japan, and this story was 14.
Mr. Janzi add sound -- he recognizes her paradise.
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are victim of a circuit that of real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes wrong in worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attackers in importance today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions -- they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have collected in the last 12 months by occupying a paper in the online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks, the criminals that do it for money, the hackers like Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the national states the governments that attack.
And then we see cases like Diagnostic.
That's a good example of government attacks against its own citizens.
Diagnosis is a certification authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
Decide the work the last fall, because of a satisfaction.
They stressed out the security of the site and they had a cyber chimpanzee.
Last week, I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people in the cause of the attack to Dickyand.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die because of an attack of these?
Diagnosis is a certified authority.
They sell certificates.
What are the certificates for?
Well, you need if you have a website, with hosts, encrypted Syria, services like Ghana.
Except that you will intercept a foreign certified authority.
And that they mimic advanced certificates.
And in the case of Dilemma happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt.
Well, in Egypt, the protesters took the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April, and during the building of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called "French Fistorner."
And within that folder there were notes from a firm company in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept large scale communities of the country's citizens.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company headquarters are right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the Cream Craig was found, a traffic used by the German government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is intervened.
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection.
They will use even tools like the Council of Christian to infect our computer with a traffic to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online arguments to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems something wrong, but I don't really affect because I'm a honest citizen.
Why would you care?
I have nothing to hide.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in the game of privacy.
Privacy is not discussing.
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about the freedom against control.
While we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we manage today, will be forever.
Are we going to be blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cow, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no close in most of the South, which means wild animals like clouds migrate freely outside of the park.
And predators, like lions. They follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we got up in the morning, and we found it dead I felt very bad because it was the only round we had.
My community, the masses, we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to punish them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up using the lions.
The dying are warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also mad with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, at age six, nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father, and this was the same thing as I was on me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of fear.
But I realized that actually this doesn't serve because I even helped lions see the star in far.
I didn't laugh. I went on.
A second idea was to use a spines.
I was trying to get the lions to believe that I was close to the test.
But the lions are very intelligent.  They came in the first day and they saw the spaces, and they left, but the second day, they went back and said, "This thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped and killed animals.
So one night was walking around the star with a torch and that day the lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that's moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got an switch that I would learn and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
It took everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery suggests the electricity to the small indicated box -- I call it a transformation.
And the indicated box makes the lights delight.
As you can see, the bags are going out, because that's where the lions come from.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights slow down and go into the lions so that you think I'm walking through the show, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never came back to trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them. You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to scare other predators like honest, lessons, and also being used to scan elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention I had the fortune to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Bureau International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and awareness.
I even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to put them.
So, a year ago, I was just a child on the salary prizes holding my father's cows from my father, and I used to see airplanes flying around, and I was telling me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get an engineer of aviation and pilot when it grows up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving my dad's cows and the lions, we can be with the lions without any conflict.
Air Olympic. What in my language means thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a barrel. Richard Turk: Yeah.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on your list?
RD: My next invention is -- I want to do an electrical fence -- CA: An electric closer close.
RD: I know that they were already invented the electric fences before, but I want to do mine.
CA: So you try it once, right?  RD: I've tried it before, but I got a calorie because I got a calorie.  CA: At the foot of the Canyon. Richard Turk, you're a big thing.
We're going to get on every step that you say, my friend.
Thank you very much. RH: Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No Indian Not."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim IUCOSE history, but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, Japan is the enemy.
Though I would sometimes ask about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister colleague.
He said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're collected together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die."
I was very alternated.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a short time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A without life was dead on the street, holding a child climbing into his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody helped them, because they were very concerned about caring about themselves and their families.
An enormous brown famine in North Korea in the middle of the 1990s.
In the end, more than a million neighborhoods died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequent the energy cortex, all around me was completely dark on the night except on the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the Middle River, which serves the limits between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very selfish at certain points, allowing rules to secure secretly nerdy.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with distant parts.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like northernal refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the Norwegian refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealized, and it would be released to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and introduced me in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being a northern, then they looked at my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and depressed.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the interrogation. He said to another, "This was a false revelation. She is not Northern it."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some Americans in China are looking for asylum.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and depressed.
These women were very lucky.
They were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These neuroscientists didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, countless neighborhoods are captured in China and sports North Korea, where they're tortured or income or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape a lot of other neighborhoods haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that the rules have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of its world can take in a moment.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
So serving in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I was hoping for.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a great gap between North and South America.
We are all Koreans, but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of divide.
Even a crisis of identity.
Am I a sub-Saharan or northwest?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could call it with me.
Though to adapt to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I did a plan, I started studying for the University of the University of college.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I got an alarming call.
North Korean authorities were introduced some money that sent my family, and as a punishment my family was going to be displaced to the force to a long location in the outside.
They had to flee.
So I started planning how to help you escape.
The rules have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and I went into the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow for more than 3,000 miles across China, and then through the South Asia.
The trip in bus took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once our bus was arrested and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of everybody and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I was implemented in my family, and I said that they were super-exposure people who were accepting.
It looked at me suspected, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the path to the Lamas border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Lamas.
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested.
After paying multiple and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and entered again in the capital of Lamas.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was held in prison at the distance of the South Korea.
I went between the immigration office and the police office, desperately trying to release my family.
It didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or multiple people.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and no doubt -- the man went to the ATM box and gave me the rest of the money for my family and the other two Koreans, and take them out of prison.
I thank you with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I helping me?"
"I'm not helping you."
"I'm helping the news new."
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The unknown stranger symbolizes a new hope for me and for the North people when we needed it.
And it showed me that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the gaps of hope that the North people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is just half the battle.
Many neuroscientists are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, the English language practices and more work practice.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very lucky, I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help you give the rules an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more neighborhoods success around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Center.
This is Center Street, little little food, fast food, bad land.
So the city planners came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Central so that it represents something else, so they changed the South Angeles, as if it would fix what actually is wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  -- stores of limits, fast food, bad land.
Just like 26 million other Americans, living in a food desert, the Angeles Central Angeles, home from the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of surgical diseases in Los Angeles Central Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I'm tired of seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of the house you see the dancing effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood.
I see chairs of wheels bought and sold as used cars.
I see centers of dilemmas planning like Starbucks.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also fall up to handle 45 minutes of it and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides that don't have perspectives.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a land sliver we call a favorite.
It's about 45 feet three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
So this was how I decided to keep her.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Group. Let's go together and start to plant our food forest -- fruit trees, you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of a group that is paid by the gardens of all the procedures, all over the city and completely volunteers, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then somebody complained to it.
The city got on top of the city, and in summary, they gave me a party by saying that I had to remove my garden, the category became a court order.
And I said, "Come on, really?
A judicial order for planting food on a piece of land that no one matters?  So I was like, "Well, let me."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve London, and he talked to the concept and one of Green Gorgers, who put a petition in Chenopy, with 900 signatures, we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My concept even called to say that they would go back and love what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more land labeles.
It has 68 miles away from labeled.
That equals 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 75 million tomato plants.
Why don't you look like this?
Growing a plant will give a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar of hands will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my member, when I tell people, grow your own food.
Growing your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Central Center.
I grew up there. I raised my kids there.
I became part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing for me by others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my graffiti -- I grow my art.
Just like an artist of graffiti -- that shakes walls -- I get sleep slime, favelas.
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my beauty of that canvas.
You would be surprised to see what the Earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You can't just imagine how amazing a signature is and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness of how my garden became a tool of education, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
They would be surprised to see how they affect kids.
The garden is the most therapeutic and provocative act that they can do, especially in a drink.
Also, they get fragiles.
I remember an occasion, which came a mother and his daughter, and they were like the 1930s, and they were in my garden and went out and looked very simply.
I, well, man, I felt bad to be there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like that.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Well, don't fear people are going to steal your food?
And what I say, "Oh my God, I am not afraid you're going to steal it."
That's in the street.
That's what it is about.
I want you to take it, but in turn, I want you to pick your health.
There was another time that I put a garden in a shelter for decousite in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys who helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous. I was shared with his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so just for a moment.
So Green Group has come to plant maybe 20 gardens here.
We've had, like 50 people who come from, work and participate, all in voluntary plan.
If kids grow up, kids will eat tail.
If you grow tomatoes -- you eat tomatoes --  But if none of this is taught -- if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they are trapped in. I see color kids that are in this room designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are coming into their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may produce the next George Washington Carner.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share food in the same picture.
I want to take container and turn them into healthy coffee.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, taking kids out of the street, who know joy, pride and honor to grow their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become electronic reference, and you have to be a constant banking, options, open-source dancers.
We have to change the script of what an announcers is.
If you're not a blueprint, you're not a guy.
That the advocates take their paper right?
That is your chemical weapon.
In fact, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some short shopping -- to talk about making some land.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your stick so that we can plant something.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Climber noise)  (Audience Microsoft.  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that suffers.
And especially if you go together in your bike and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make perfect asphalt.
The porous, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has foot and water can go through it, so all the rainwater water will flow down the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and they won't sacrifice water.
The noise will also disappear in these pores as well.
Because it's very healing -- the whole noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has disasters, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can get rid of it.
What is to get down? You see that in this road, the stone stones come out.
First one stone, then several more and more, and so on, and then -- well, I won't do that.  But you can give you your parasites, and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create whales with that.
Ah, it's ready.
Backs, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage looks like in this material.
It's a proud asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of drag between the stones here.
Because of the interspecies, to the ultraviolet light, to the oxytocin, this book, this bond, the glue between the arms, to find, and if you come up, you will become microbes and get separate from the adventures.
So if you drive through the road, you will take the adventures -- as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about authority materials.
If we can make this material be automatically, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel laughter, from that to clean serious, and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the battle.
So we have asphalt with small pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to cook -- a machine of industries.
Industry can heat up, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the button, the button will flow through these microbes and the rocks will go back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great manufacturing machine here at the stage.
The horizon of microbes is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to try it."
So we had a piece of road, 400 meters from the AIDS highway, where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the road test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples of this road, and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples old, we put a lot of charge on them, we repair them then with our manufacturing machine and we repair them and we put them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers using the energy energy to actually increase the life surface of the road, even if you can double the life on the surface, you can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity of whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to face first before you can show you how the repair is.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woke up a morning with the sound of the obsolete in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News, in his little gray radio radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual in those times, because news usually depressed.
"The Taliban were gone, I grew up my father.
I didn't know what it meant but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school, and he said.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came out of Afghanistan and made illegal that the girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a child to escort my older sister, who couldn't be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could both be able to educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could suspect where we were.
We had to hide the books on market bags so that it seemed like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us lost in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew that we were running our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban suspected supported.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we live?
We were attracted, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a treasure.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total concept of a remote province of Afghanistan, insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and that's why her father repeated it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It's going to retire two years ago, just to become our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the talents, despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk not to educate his children.
During the years, I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, "Member, my father -- you can lose everything you have in your life.
You can steal your money. You can force you to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want not to continue?
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than balance, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate in Diamoroga College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was removed from his home for the courage of educating his daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate his daughter.
He doesn't just get out of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, which I carry it driving down the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global embryonic of 1800, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLEC, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls going to school.
What's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, they speak for them, despite and even in front of a daunting opposition to it.
Like Ahmed. It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went from South AIDS to his village, and literally they were unable to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When he got to his house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would try.
"My being already, if you want to say, "But I won't give the future of my daughter for his old and returned idea."
What I've given me about Afghanistan, and it's something that's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom we succeed, there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often they're the first compelling interests of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school are in hundreds of hundreds, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of change.
I fear these changes don't last much, after the return of the U.S. troops in the United States.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students at my school and their parents who advocate for them, that they encourage them, I see a promise future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and living possibility, and every day the Soldier girls remind me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the existence, "Hey, resident to Gadda struggle with him.
But you never become a Galapago Revolution.
They've spent almost two years since it was the clean revolution inspired by the Olympics of mass movements as much as the Egyptian revolution.
A forces with many other light citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day of flu and start a revolution against Galvao rich regime.
And we succeeded. It was a big revolution.
Women and young men were in the forefront of the variation, making the fall of the regime, providing freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a value to be confronted by the brutal brick of Gallafer.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity, from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses of about 50,000 death, we managed to release our country and break into the stream.
However, Galla left a heavy peace, a legacy of strange, corruption and alternative seeds.
For four decades, the Galapago monetary regime destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure of clean society.
conscious of devastation and challenges, I've wanted to, along with many other women, rebuild clean civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and fair to democracy and national reconciliation.
It was set up about 200 organizations in Benjamin in General, and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Trier.
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capacity, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the Women's League platform for peace, a movement of women, leaders of very diverse to advocate for the social autonomy of the woman and by our right of equal participation in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the prefrontal period -- an environment that was increasingly police, which was model of selfish policy and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won 17 percent of National Congress in the first 52 years.
However, the energy of election and revolution as a whole, they were disappearing, every day we found news of violence.
One day we wake up with the news of the former mosques and the Sufi family.
Another day I ended up with the news of the American ambassador and the attack to the collection.
Another day we wake up with the news of the army official murder of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and their continents of human rights violence and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made by a revolutionary mindset, became more pollinated and moved from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intolerance, the exclusive and the revenge.
I'm not here today to inspire them with our story of the success of "the "creation and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose bad, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The break and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why do our society continue to be polarized and mastered with selfish policies of domination and exclusion, both for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing were not just women, but the female values of compassion, mission and inclusion ...
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of more than the election needed -- that only reinforce polarization and division alone.
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of the female female than need the numerical and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an agent of indicator and calling from anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mission.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not only honest, but also put the mission in the mistake of the breakthrough, the collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by the war, desperately needs to get peace for peace.
Because peace has an argument that is about intelligence and alternative between female perspectives and male perspectives.
That's the real break.
We need to set up that in an existential way before we do it social form.
According to a version of the Koran "California, peace -- is the word of the Minister of Mission -- "of computing."
At the same time, the word "Range," which is known in all the wireless traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word Random -- similaritizing the feminine and the material, that he fits all the humanity that men and women, who all tribes and all the peoples have ended.
And so as the uterus is completely covering the embryo, growing in, the divine matrix of compassion is all the existence.
This is what it tells us, "My mission takes all the things."
This is how we say, "My mission prevents about my opening."
And that is all about the grace of the minister.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a disturbing question, which has an equally unexpected answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to talk about is the one that everyone goes, why is she left?
Why was anybody going to stay with a man who preparsed it?
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no experience in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I was just released at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editors in the journal Sender.
I had my first apartment, my first Green Argentina, American Expression, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I created my graduate soul, he pointed to the head with a pink, carrying with balls of shoulder straighter.
The man, which I loved more than anybody in this world, put a pistol in my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love -- a psychological trap. Love designed, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm licensed in English at Harvard University and I have an MBA in marketing from the White Business School School.
I've spent most of my career working for the collection of "Free 500 companies, between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burkeard and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and The Washington Post, and
I take almost 20 years on my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black border and a Hong Yorker minister.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all race, all religions, all the levels of area and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the males are men, and domestic abuse only happens in intimate relations, interpretation and long duration or saying another way, in families, the last place where we want or expect to find violence, reason why the domestic abuse is so unfair.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who was paying him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and more than 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, novelists and abusive husband in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting on my side in the subway of New York and started to flow with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just released from a University of the Logo English University and worked in a very important bank in Wall Street.
But what struck me most at the first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
He had big models like apples, and a broken hair shoulder, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things I did Congo, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning putting on a pediatrician.
We started out and loved everything about me: I was ready that I had gone to Harvard -- that I had passion to help girls teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
Congo believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And that's why the license on that prestigious school and the work at Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to seduce and make the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York City and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I accepted my job and Congo and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a little love, which was entering the head of a physical trap. Financial and psychological transformation.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how she reacts her.
And this is where they go into the scene those clues.
As soon as we move to New England you already know, that site where I was supposed to be so secure had to feel so safe to buy three pinks.
One had in the car guide.
The other one was stored under the pillow in our bed and the third time in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those pilots because of the trauma that lived as a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those pilots actually were a message for me, and even though I had never raised my hand, my life was already in serious serious every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of Congo happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the table.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's girlfriend's suit, and I married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we would live happily forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very short.
It just had been very abunded by the wedding.
I had been an isolated accident and I would never make me harm.
I spent twice as much as our honey moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and lost me, and he gave me so strong in the head that bounces several times against the window of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, he got dressed by the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
Congo kept asking me one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or access at some point in their life, and the Control Center of informed diseases that every year 15 million children are made, 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
And coming back to my question, why was I sticking?
The answer is simple.
He didn't know that he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply metroduced man, and it was the only person in the world that could help Congo face their demons to face.
The other question that everybody is doing is, why don't you just go?
Why didn't I go? I could have gone at any time.
To me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we victims, we know something that normally you ignore, is incredibly dangerous to abandon a males.
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the killings in the cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has finally gone to the relationship, after they get off, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent cost, even after the abuse has come back to married financial resources, financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to terrified victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges to spend time not overcome with the man who would put their mother.
And yet, we continue to ask, why don't you just go?
I was able to get me, because of a last paper that came up with my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed me if I had allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family, to the full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to force victims like speculative tools, self-destructive women, damaged goods.
The question, "Why is it stopped?
For some people, it's a way to say, "The blame is its for being stopped, as if the victims choose to be able to interact with men who want to destroy them.
But since I published "Charled love," I've heard hundreds of men and women who were also embedded, who learned an initiative lesson of what happened to them and they refuse their lives and happy life and happy as employees, wives, and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence.
I became married with a man and nice man and we have those three children.
I have that black bond and also that minister.
What I'm not going to go back to have never more, ever, is a pink pistol pointing into my head in someone who says that I want.
So at this point, just as you're thinking, "Hall, that's fascinating." or "Hall, what silly it was, but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, of those who are listening to me right now, that are being made out of male or that they were little or that they're automatic astronomers.
The male could be affecting his daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love breaking silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse only thrives in silence.
They have the power to end the domestic violence just throwing light on it.
Victories need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They shake the male to light talking about it with his children, their coworkers and their friends and family.
They relate their vision of survivors as fantastic and amazing people, who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to be able to consciously intervene their scale and show the victims a safe output.
Together, we can turn our beds together, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful orders that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. My name's Cameron Russell -- and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, since 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this time, there's an awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed like that.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first shift of clothing at a TED stage, so you have a lot of lucky enough to press it, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when I came up, they don't have to tell you now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These spots are very uncomfortable -- less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to spend this sweater. Because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also surface.
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that he would archive the back and put the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that made me two days ago to work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which even though surface and immune, it has a great impact on our lives.
So today, to me, it means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do me, but single significant.
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a cartoons found me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the benefit of a heritage and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to admire -- we also have associated with a high shape and strange figure, to the feminist and a white skin.
And that's my heritage -- the heritage I've known to take money to earn money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now shows skeptical. And maybe there are some lovers of the fashion that say, wait, there are Namibia, Tudolo, Joan Smilins, Liz Web.
First of all, the happiness for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told each and every one of the models on the runway, and from the 777 models, just 27 models -- that means less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can I be model when you get up?"
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a neurological surgeon surgeon, which would be awesome, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, still instantly, no, no, Camero, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my boss man.
Because I am not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of the redesign of the American Vietnam magazine or the Health executive director of MIT, or the next Steven Mexico.
To say that more you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's outside your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike cardiovascular surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've done your studies, and you have a curriculum and a few jobs to your backs, no longer matter what you say, is to say, if you say you want to be president of the United States, but your block said, model of inner clothes for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always make me is if all pictures are recovering.
And yes, practically all of the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that they took me, and also the first time I used a biologist, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering personal land, but it was a girl.
So I light next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a phase party a few days before the French cowboy pictures of the French vote.
Here I am with my football team and Vietnam magazine.
And this is me at the time.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're creations of a group of professionals, streets, calculators, photographers and statistics, and all their aid and pressure people and production, and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is: Do you get free things?
I have too many of the touches of 20 inches and I never use, except the previous couple, but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress to me.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a product paralyzed, and he jumped out a red seed and of course, and of course, they stopped us, and he took a sense of it, agents to be able to keep driving.
I enjoy these privilege by my appearance, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their appearance, no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the 14,000 teenagers who were given and recorded -- 86 percent black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only 170 young black men and Latin in New York, so for them, it's not a question of the partnership?
But how many times do I stand in? And what?
By researching for this talk, I found out that to 53 percent of the 13 years in the United States you don't like your body, and that number rises to 78 percent at the top.
So, the last question that people do is, what is life of a model?
And I think the answer they hope is, if you're a little bit more thin and you have the brightest hair, you feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like this.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing power to work with creative and ingenious and passionate people.
And that's true, but it's just a part of what's going on, because what we never say in front of the cameras -- which I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair, will be happier.
They just have to go together with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs and the beautiful hair and the moving of the fashion -- but they probably are the most physically insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the greatest benefits.
If there's something to get out of this talk, I hope that everybody feels more comfortable when we recognize the power of the image that we have success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was the biggest enough to overcome a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more precise pictures of it, and I wasn't going to get them up.
There were no artistic directors, no statistics, no opportunity to repeat photos -- not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took the random turtles.
My story begins when, finding in New York City to give a difference, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday -- that's the corner of the 57 and five birthday.
He gave the chance that we came back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you to Cape to New York on a harmful trip and you continue the ritual and continues.
This is when we started asking tourists that would happen to get us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever heard of the camera.
And so we were not aware of how much life is going to change us.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representatives of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect about our time and our evolution over the years, not only physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter raises new milestone and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, on one of the travel, we were walking in, when suddenly he stopped in dry and pointed out a red hole of the grocery store that he was looking at in the previous visit.
And he described to me what had felt at five years old in that same place.
I started to remember his heart to pass out with force when you first saw nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging actively in creating conscious memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get in many of the family photos.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't doubt to get to somebody and ask yourself, "Do you take a picture of it?
Thank you.
I would like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The burns are in the most threatened bird group.
First of all, why do they have so bad present?
It's also associated with Disney laughter personalized characters like mental characters, dumb characters, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press, laughter and allies these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan parliament, but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment --   Paradise don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They're just monitoring.    You're far from extinct.  And my favorite, the burns have better presence.   There are two kinds of burns on this planet.
There are the buttons of the New World who are primarily found in America, like the cells and the characters, and the Buddhists of the Old World, where we have 16 species -- from these 16, 11 confronted a high risk of extinction.
So why are the burns important? First of all, provide vital ecological services, Liberia.
These are our natural garbage collects.
They clean the blood to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that they won't be for them to extend and cause great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no burns, the carcasses take three to four times more time in decent, and this has huge ramifications in spreading disease.
The burns also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture.
Nelson was the symbol of the prototype and the maternity and along with copper -- they simulated the unit between the Alto and the Under Egypt.
In the Hindu mythology, Japan was the god bound, and he risked his life to save the Singapore Side of 10 Haiti Headard.
In the Tibetan culture, there's a lot of important entrepreneurs on open sky -- in places like the Tibet, there is no place to bury death, or wood to create them, so these burns provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the buttons?
We have eight species of burns in Kenya, which six are at the extreme threat threatened of extinction.
The reason is that they're being sentenced, and the reason that they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and fauna, the pastic communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the burns are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of burns are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, they will be extinct, and the reason is because they fall prey from the consumer consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like the Disney.
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India, and they've taken a posture.
Since there are no burns, there has been a spread in the number of street dogs in streets of breadwinning, and when you have street dogs -- you have a huge time bomb for railor. The number of rage cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, 335 airplanes are going to be up on top of the Turkey lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of dead burns to serve the balance and the fear market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're putting them transmitters.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a very local problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciation the burns, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services they provide.
How can you help you? You can get active, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very bold creatures -- I'll give you their time to spread the word. The word.
When you go out of this room, you will report on the burns, but talk to their families, with your children, with your neighbors on the books.
They're very elegant. Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it flying without effort, without spending energy in the sky.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do professionally -- it's been shaped for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1971, until 1977, I get young, but I'm no longer --  I worked in Zambia.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Archimede and Somalia, in technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO and every project we set up in French Africa.
And he was performing.
I thought, at the age of 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we touched we sended it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "One of the Zambia was a project where we decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we got to Italian seeds south of the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the Zalio River, and we teach the local local tomatoes and the sunlight and and so on.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't happen.  We were astonished that local, in so fertile Valley, had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  "I just have time to save people from the Hambor of Hammer."
And of course, everything in Africa was very beautifully culture.
We got these magnificent tomatoes in Italy, a shot would grow up to this size. In Zambia.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the goals, "Look at how easy agriculture is.
When the tomatoes were nice, mature and red, at night to morning, about 200 hypothesis appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the goals, God my hypothesis.
And the galaxies said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why didn't you say that? You never ask you."
I thought only the Italians were making errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans do, what the English did, what the English did, and then I saw what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least feed the hypothesis.
You should see the waste.  You should see the waste that we give you to the confidence of people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read "Here Dead Dead, a woman economist economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We, we Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars over the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has cause.
Just read your book.
Watch it from an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are implicitively, collaborative missions, and we treat people only two ways: or participants, or we are patients.
The two words come from the Latin Latin Rat, which means "part and me."
But they mean two different things.
Patiens, I treat any different culture as if my children are -- "I want a lot."
Passion, I treat all of a different culture as if my services are.
So the white in Africa is called "The Bank, order.
That book gave me a slap on the face -- "The little beauty is beautiful -- written by Schwarzschild, who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be helped by being helped alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to breathe.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neurological?
I decided at 27 years old, I only respond to people, and I invented a system called Eastern Company where you never start anything, but it becomes a service of the local passion, the service of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So, what does you do? It's a street.
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it feels like the people of locality.
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We sat in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, we listen to them, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never accept, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they've identified.
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't get their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face -- you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family of the company, the business family, the business family, who set up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps you find resources to transform your passion in a way of making life.
And I started this as a test in hope, Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this design garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on it, and the government came to me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I stand up and I listen to them.  So --  So the government says, "Hey again."  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness.
Peter Drug, one of the greatest corporate advisers in history, passed down at 16, a few years ago.
Peter Drug was a philosophy professor before we involved in business, and this is what Peter Drug says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company.
Planning is the kiss of the death of corporate spirit.
So now you do now rebuild Christian without knowing what the most stupid people in Christian want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you conflict, privacy, you have to be fantastic when you help them, and then you will come up, you'll come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion.
What do you have applied more this morning, you know?
Local people. That's what you have applied.
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The brakes as a way of holding machines is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we nurture -- we cure ourselves, we educate, we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for green revolution? University?
The government -- forget it.
You will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in 1860.
And in the year 1860, this group of people came together, and they speculated what happened to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was an uncomfortable, the city of New York didn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve, and they pointed out, if the population kept growing up to this rate, to train the population of New York around the road, required six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address it.
They were already getting in structure.  So in 1860, they were having this dirty technology that would build the life in New York.
So what's going on? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, the United States appeared 100 authoritarian manufacturing companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few scars, scarces, factories in place.
Derek, Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you confirming.
Otherwise, you won't come to conversation with you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute, dedicated service, enthusiastic service.
And eventually, you will have to tell you the truth with how to understand it.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three magnetic things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to be a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell you with a great financial management.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
There is no exist.
This is still not born.
We've investigated and looked at the 100 companies in the world of Carnegie world, Washington, Edison Edison, Ford all new companies, Google, Aarama.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: None of them was started by one person.
I would never have the word "I me, but the word "Wow! 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community where we have facilitators, who come from an environment of small businesses sitting on coffee and bars next to their dedicated dedicated people who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this epidemic, somebody who talks to you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
OK, can you sell it? Can you look for money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people who surround us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange much knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like astronomers, plants and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their apartments?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape?
How do we share our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today?
I live in New Orleans and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with the giant trees that give shadows and drunk and sounds from centuries and trust in a city.
It always gives music to music.  There's a mess in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the largest number of American properties.
I live close to this house and thought how I could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was John, like a mother for me.
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this produced me a deep gratitude for the living time.
He gave it clear to the significant things of my current life.
But I brought out to keep this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let you catch through day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned on a giant board and painted on her phrases to fill up, before I die, I want to."
So, the transistors could take a chalk. I would think about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait from this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept covering it.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die, I want to be judged by pink person --  before I die, I want to sit on horseshing on the date of challenge change."
"Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree.
"Before I die, I want to live outside the network."
"Before I die, I want to hug it once again."
"Before I die, I want to go to someone's rescue.
"Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at cartoons, and they showed me, and they gave me comfort in difficult moments.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and stressed ways -- it's about giving birth to the reflection and contrast, and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year and started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my civic center colleagues, we made a kit and now have been done in countries around the world, like Karalins, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we show the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of activity, it is more important than ever, find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief.
The death is something that we often avoid to talk about, or even think, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that make us more power.
Think of the dirty death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fear and stories, people around us not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request today.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
It was 22 years old, it's high and very guardian.
I don't talk about it, but it transmits better than some of the best speakers.
Remot knows what love is.
And I shared it financially what happens.
It's not an anti-political. It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about the religious differences and think about this: has never lied.
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to make words that I couldn't even remind me, I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very guardian.
It has the most impressive memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year I came out every single song in my iPod -- conversations that we kept when I was four years old, to get my arm in my arm during the first episode of the Telescopes and the Lady Galapagos birthday.
Isn't it amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't adjust to the concept of normal society, they're often ignored and understandably.
But what drives my heart and forced my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them within the ordinary thing, that could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary and amazing.
Now, for those less familiar families with the term autism, it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every individual is manifest in a different way, that Remot is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the disorders of development that is faster increase in the world, there is no cause or cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember a single day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
I recorded a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He was living in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing washing and eating anything that would be between media.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the browser, the frustration and the endless hypertension, there was something really unique. A pure and innocent nature -- a child that saw the world without president, a human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish they were just like me.
But I look at the things that I've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
normality. normal.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could convey one thing to Rome and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have, are a double: Each one of us has a gift in its interior, and honestly, the pursuit of normality.
The opportunity for great, progress and change die at the time that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it should have been to be Alice in the Mariesove country.
Penn State asked me to do a communications professor, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  It was really frightened -- I was scared of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big words and unknown words.
But by developing those conversations -- I felt what Alice should have felt when I fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to environment and health care, between others, and if we don't know this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to respond to you and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
They don't just tell us that they study the trusts, but they study the trustworths, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat optimisms.
And when they're describing their science, care of the jargon.
The jargon is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say, "Space and temperature, but why not say space and time: that is much more accessible to us?
To make them accessible is not the same thing to do with them.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples and stories and analogies -- they are ways to get off and engage with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget from the sign signs.
Have you been wondering why they're called balls?  What do the balances do? Balances kill and kill their presentation.
A film like this is not just boring, but it gets too supportive in the language of our brain and it opens up.
Instead, this example of General Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of the trunks is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower Toronto.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, legitimate, that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that apply to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what is described with.
I think these are just some key things that can help others open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they solved this equation, all the media -- beautiful with simple.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of the whole dictionary of English Oxford is Leonardo."
Just because it sounds very good.
And "London means "standard "policy" meaning.
Although there was a periodic editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A self-destruction is the one that seeks a public charge without matter party, platform or beginning, and that, when you win, you get it for the first use of a monitor regret monitor.
I have no idea what it means "step."
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't until -- for example, 1777 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliament chamber.
And all of this was because of the value of a guy with the name of Bruce Craig, who was confronted with Parliament and parallel.
They got on the London of London and they sprayed him, but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end of it had such a popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase -- because of the metal back and so forth.
Most people think it's literature.
It's not. It's because of a freedom of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and policy interact -- I want you to go back to America, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence, right after independence,
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was defined in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions that might have been frustrated.
Some of you wanted to call it "The Washington State West World West Winter: Other "Highs Window, "Here and other "Defense Western Left Left Language "freedom."
Not very attractive.
Some of you just wanted to call it "Keer:
They thought it was proven quality.
And even with it, they were monitoring, they had the idea that one could be elected King for a certain deadline.
And it could have served it.
Everyone gets tired of it, because this debate is produced for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor sense, and I always wrote, still with this issue.
What caused the room and the height was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The House of Representatives did not want Washington to get rid of power.
They didn't want to call it Ken for if he was giving him to him or her ideas.
So, they wanted to give it the most modest title, more inspirational and more unfortunate that came out of them.
And that title was "President."
President. They didn't invent the title -- there was already before, but it only meant somebody who presented a meeting."
It was like the president of a jury.
And it didn't have much bigger than the term "chapter," or "supercomputer."
There were emotional presidents of small colonial and government and government fractions, but it was really an insignificant title.
And so the Senate was operated.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it President."
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with foreign digits.
"And who is going to be serious with a title as ridiculous and insignificant as president of the United States?
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't celebrate.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to find out, the Senate has never been framed in the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate to be in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary --  -- it's possible that we keep waiting for 22 more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and I want to leave you -- that the U.S. President title doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to available, the largest economy of the world and a flexible air fleet and so on.
The reality and history have hit the glacier title.
So in the end, I won the Senate, so at the end.
They got their responsibility.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of uniqueness -- well, it was a silent by then.
But you know how many nations do you have now.
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end of the Sendary won and the House of Republic lost, because no one is going to feel humble when they tell you that they're now the President of the United States.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and I would like to leave them.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually, the reality of the world is much more the words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in an illegal mine from Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that calculator of male toxins and stones with primitive tools.
As the other ones, I carry a cheap literature of red light on the head with this alternative alternative, and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole of a meter that takes hundreds of meters on the ground.
My hand is reliable and suddenly I remember a minority that I met days before, who lost control and female men in that piece.
As I talk to you today, these guys are in the deep side of that hole risking their lives without paying or reward, and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it, because they're pressure of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition in the Vancouver Peace Court.
Among all the amazing people that I met there met a "Prince of French the San San San And an NGO who will eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that existed in the world, but not such grade.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very bad. Honestly, I was embarrassed to ignore this task of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I was asked by the stomach and, weeks later, flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of "Free the Seat and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered them my second home.
But this time, the dirty trains ...
A conservative calculation says that there are currently over 27 million people who are enslaved in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all the treatment of traditional slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
However, today you can be subtled to entire families by the generations of the average dollars of 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates profit of more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promise of good education and better work to find out that they're forced to work without pay, low violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the memory, the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disasters.
Solar exists in almost everybody, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the blocks of bricks.
This weird and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the hell of Daniel.
Inside of a temperature of 54 C, men, women, kids, in fact, the whole families in fact, families in a heavy period of powder -- mechanically stack bricks in their heads, until 18 at the time, and take them from the ordinary furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
They disappeared by the monkeys and the song work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no pause to eat, no to drink, and the severe dragonfliction made it sound pretty intriguing out.
So penguins were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to review it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry, but the abundance that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "Long, don't do it. Don't do it."
And I explained very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already.
I had to rely on "Free the Seat and work inside the system for his liberation and I trusted that they would get it.
As far as me, I waited to get home to feel my desperate heart.
In the Himalayas, I found children running rocks for miles for mountain land to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big plants were more heavy than the kids who caught them and the children subject them to their heads with homemade emails made from steps, ropes and deals.
It's hard to present something so overwhelmed.
How can we influence something so initial, but so uncomplete?
Some don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without paying -- because this has been that whole life.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villagers were recorded their freedom, the slaves burn their houses.
When we hear the word slavery we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, they warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Katrina, I was accompanied by women who had previously been sexual slaves.
I was driven by some selfish stairs that would give this dirty basement of faint light.
It wasn't exactly a border.
It was more a restaurant.
Rebellian -- as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms where slaves with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to train customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sexual abuse for their clients.
From foot in the penguin, I remember having felt like an ordinary acute fear and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a sales, the stairs where I walked in.
There were no legs.
There were no windows enough to climb in.
Those people have no escape and, since we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery -- even the sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people enslaved in agriculture, in restaurants in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It happens everywhere, but we don't see it.
The texture is another activity that we often relate to slave labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait of family.
The hands of black are the father of the father, the blue trees and the red, of their children.
They mix ink in these big barrels and dive the silk in the liquid to the elbow, but the ink is toxic.
My interpretation told me his stories.
"We don't have freedom, they said.
"We still hope, though, you can get out of this house one day and go somewhere else where we really pay our work."
It is estimated that there are more than 4,000 children selected in the volatile lake, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a boat, two older brothers, some younger children, makes sense of it?
mistake. They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their trade-upsed families, disappeared and forced to work strange strings in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up, he was funding -- the little canoe was served.
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the tree trees in Lake Volvonal often attract networks and children, faster and fear -- they drag into the water to unleash the branches.
Many of them get stuck.
Since I remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
As a fear of his love is not going to flee and as a whole life has been treated with creation, it's cruel to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were lifted up the last five, but they had been working from one one.
At night and selfish night.
And it falls out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they are reporters of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kooko.
Kofi was rescued in a fishing village.
I met it in a shelter. I met it in a shelter.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who is going to be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
driving by a road in Ghana with President Saturday Spanish, a power with his bike, suddenly accelerate and support our car and play the window.
He asked us to follow it by a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we went out of the car, and I asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then I pointed out this slow slide and said, "This is the way, this is the path. Go!
As we started to go down, we removed the entertainments that blocked the path and after walking about an hour -- we found that the path was added by the recent rain, so I put the photo team on my head as we go through these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walk, the wild path ended up absolutely in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that I could fit in a football camp, and they were all filled with standardized workers.
Many women had kids tied to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, they walked in sentence water with memory.
The market is used in the process of extraction.
These minutes are enslaved in a pit in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were packed in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irritated, because many had been underground.
The wells have up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy bags of stone than then they will be transported to another area where they will kill the stone so that they can extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong and virtual men, but if you look closer on close, we see the margin to work to other lunch and also children.
They're all victims of injuries and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and the sentence of the market in a few years.
This is Manhattan. When her father died, her father took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying his uncle, Mahan inherit the debt of the uncle what force it to be slave in mines.
When I met it, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so severe that the doctors said it should be amputed.
In addition to that, Manhattan has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Still, he dreams of being released and educated with local activists like "French the Seat, and it's this kind of determination from face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll give them testimony of them and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines -- they're from people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, males that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force goes up a fire and that fire struggles a fire, because without that light, the self-destruction beach can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make a math app and there's a peculiar problem for who do it -- we are like management consumption.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We dislike the viruses of the whale and the click dancers -- we will see more ahead.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably certain initial attitude that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's evil destroyed gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jane Street who, at his time, was a virtual value of ball.
In the last few years it's gotten a lot of progress in treatment.
However, there are 6.3 million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable weakness and threats, rich and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in a target way, and ultimately, the only way we can know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective and cerebral medium.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a 200-year neurologic test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside clinical trials, they're never done. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult journey to the clinic. What if patients could be done the same?
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as a nonprofit way to try and try and see it in a sense at least we are all virtuous, like my friend Jane Strain friend.
This is a video of the violence of vocal strings.
He shows someone healthy as they get to sound -- we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the necessary genes -- the Oxford, for example.
And like the ball, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Think about the time that it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of vocal strings as they vibrate -- and as the Parkinson's affecting extremism, it also affects the vocal organs.
On the bottom of the bottom, you can see an example of irregular threat from the vocal strings.
We see the same symptoms.
The real transfer, breadwinning and risk.
The speech becomes more quiet and appropriate after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with specialized clinical trials, well, both of them are not invisible.
The neurological test is not invasive -- both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They're both accurate. Well, but also the experiments based on voice are not specialized.
I mean, you can be carried.
They do very quickly, about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're a minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
When something gets a cost so low, it goes on to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address them.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
It would not need to go to the clinic for routine character.
With high-speed monitoring we could get objective data.
We could make massive recording receptor for clinical trials, and for the first time, we choose fascinating scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biodiversity biomass before it is too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the vocal Internet of the Parkinson's Prison.
Together Alamati and Palestinians, we want to record lots of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
Whatever or without Parkinson's, you can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached seven percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So Max taking all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to get from these samples?
Max Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Hatcher: Yeah, you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease.
MO: You see, some people may not pass it. You may not finish it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for the confusion factors in pursuit of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now?
MO: A lot more than that.
Actually, my student Tananasaht -- I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on mobile phone network also, which affects the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy now.
TR: Nine and nine. Well, it's an improvement.
MO: Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Little, public.
MO: Thank you, Tom Tom.
Before March 2011, I made photographic records in New York City.
We're predicted creatures, gray.
We hide in the dark, in fourth without windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin thin models even more skinny, the perfect skin even more perfect we do the impossible -- possible and criticize us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
Shortly later, an organization where it was volunteers, there Hans Volvos, was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join me to the group for three weeks.
On May 13 traveled to Obama.
It's a little town of fishermen located in the president of Islamic in almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The recorded water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles into the ground.
As you can imagine, the village was devastated.
We took scales from the channels and the cards.
We cleaned up schools, and we took the slime home and we left the ready houses to be renovated and rehabilitation.
We took tons and tons of dead fish, so sterilizing, rotten from the local factory.
We were exchanged and loved us.
For weeks, both the volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and bottles of pictures and cameras and SETI cards.
Everybody did the same.
You pick them up and take them to different places from all around you to save them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had suffered in.
As they go out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started helping in a village assessment center.
He helped clean the communal bathrooms the huge, giant bars.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the emergency center would pick up the photos.
There they were taking them out there, and I had the honor that that day would trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspired -- I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until transmitted myself my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still on the lab on the lab, I couldn't help to think about how to fix that jar and repair that rare and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night came in Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try.
So we started collecting the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too spiritually, but where the water had declared the face of the girl had to fix with a lot of precision and delicious.
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the spoiled picture.
With the step of time, they came up with more photos, and they needed more retrospective things that went into Facebook and Linka and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
At the age of two weeks I had 150 people to join together.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Rubyride -- a neighboring village north of Amant.
Once a week, we used our scanner in the temporary photographic libraries that had been installed where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time they were trying to give them is a different story, depending of course the perfect of the photos.
I could make an hour. I could make weeks.
It could involve months.
This men had to draw virtually by using how the areas whose color and detail the water had not destroyed it.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures in the saltwater, covered with bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, all of it with the step of time continued to destroy them, so cleaning them by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't pick up the picture unless it was clean and dry and had been recorded by his owner.
We were lucky with the clean hand.
We count the guide of a neighborhood advance.
It's very easy to give even more the pictures of the day.
As Handy once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to photos.
He had started to clean them herself but he stopped the realization that he gave them even more.
I also had doubled.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not be able to rebuild it, we could flap the images in one picture and pick up the full picture.
When he collected his pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a bomb station between the pretty far away from where their house used to be, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter of closing the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the sand sunshine.
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day he gave her her pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could do, something that he could remember from the past that he hadn't been killed by the past day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there to the Netherlands hundreds of them helped us clean up over 150,000 photos -- the vast majority -- the vast majority of them went back to their owners -- important.
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 hundreds of fully respected and recovered pictures.
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printer.
We take pictures of them.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, somebody wanted to.
They're guards of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing we would look for.
And this was what the project was, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a great difference in the life of retailers.
Some of them connected to some of them with something larger to return something, using their talent for something that are not perfect models of skin.
And I would like to read this email to you to read this email. I sent it Cinema the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I realized, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathered around a baby, controlled me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter was born the collection of our wall.
In the entire world, all the time our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.  Allies.
Dr. Edward inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a half billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present a new kind of photography, the photographer, a new technique so fast that can create videos in slow camera from light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the corners, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray X, and they really challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser spot and turn it up and turn it into a second or so, in several seconds, you can create a picture of just a millimeter of bits.
And that photo package -- that ball, will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
If we take that bullet and this picture of photons and shoot in this bottle, how do those pictures are disappeared inside this bottle.
What is the aspect of light in slow motion.
Now, all of this --   remember, all of this happens effectively at less than a nanotucture is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coke didn't add this research.  So a lot of things in this film, to give you this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to go through it, and inside it starts to disappear.
Part of the light flows, it goes to the table, and we started looking at these values.
Many of the photons finally reach the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, waves travel through the table, and because of the top reflection of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several frames that the reflection is focused on.
Now, if we take a common ball and we make it take the same distance and see it in a slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet in motion.
What about testing with dead nature?
You can see the waves that are coming from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I think, from a drug at a time, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this shot, you will realize that, as the light gets away from the tomato -- it's still brilliant. It's not safely.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the red light inside its interior, and it goes back after several trillion seconds.
In the future, when this drug is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
So why do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photographer, you know, if we take a picture at low exposure, it enters very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure, so you can barely get some light.
So we sent that bad, that package of photographs, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very huge synchrony, we took those gigabytes of data and we trained them computational to create those females that I showed you.
We can take all those data in crude and process them in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
What if a new power of a superstar future would allow you to see the corners?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. Rebond, go into the room, a part of it is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light retrovirs.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left is our medical.
Behind the wall there's a hallucination and we will bounce the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Communications.
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works like this fast, our female feedback, has unique capacity.
It has very good temporary resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to what distance.
When you project a laser, you can record a picture in brick, that you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, will put them together and try to analyze the multiple libraries of light, and with that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D 3D?
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collision with what's going around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build the wires of seeing the inside of the body by adding options, and the same thing for charges as well.
But of course, because of tissue and blood this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about photography as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as Dr. Edge, he was a scientist, became a science in art, an art of transplanted photographs.
And I realized that all the digital digits that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can.
Create a new form of computational photography with slow camera and color code.
And let's look at those waves. Remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few trillion seconds.
But this is a funny thing as well.
If you look at the waves underneath the lid -- these are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost the speed of light, we have strange effects. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
By applying the corresponding warping of space and time, we can run this distortion to it.
That's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile can change life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a cell phone, you can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song and get it to Sudan and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a guy in 1984 and living in Berlin City.
Let's go back to that moment to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were trying to look for a change.
This is 1989. Imagine if all these people who are sitting in search for change, had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who of them have a cell phone here?
Get them up.
Raise your mobile phone, take them out."
Get it. An Andrew, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, my cell phone, and how life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 percent lines of information.
Data in brick.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission -- I presented a direction.
The databases.
This director says that every European company, every single provide on the Internet has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls the whom -- who sends an email to why.
Who sends a text.
And if we use mobile phone, where we are.
This whole information is stored by at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company or your Internet provider.
And all across Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data feedback.
We want the ambiguous in the digital age, and we don't want phone phones and the Internet providers store all this information about us.
There were adolescents, journalists, priests -- everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and said, "Liberal, I don't fear.
And some of you even said that this would be the State 2.0.
The State was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also asked if this works really.
Can you store all this information about us?
Any time I use the mobile phone?
So I asked my telephone -- Declaration Telescope, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please.
I asked them once, and I went back to it, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah blah -- ballet.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are protecting my life.
So I decided to start a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Delhi Teleon said no, we won't give you this information.
In the end, we signed an agreement.
I would give up the demand and they would send me the information that I had.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional Court failed the incompases for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly feet on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Three and five thousand trains of information.
At the beginning, I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little scary: what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data feedback means.
So, next to Keith Olympic and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom up and go, go back and forward.
You can see every step I go.
And you can see how I go from Franklin in train to colony and how often I call it in the journey.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to each other, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate each other to what hour they call each other, to how long they sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the group leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who sent an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and even two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone cell phone.
And the State had known who involved in this protest, and if the State had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And in consequence -- not the fall of the High Court.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to store them forever.
But automation and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for automation.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home and tell their friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not going out of fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what data store from you.
So in the future, every time they use their mobile phones that serves them to remember that they have to fight for the autonomy in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDGlobal, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDGlobal, what happens?
My name is Massachuse Zackern and I'm not a bunch, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, shown the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain paralysis, that's why all the time.
Look at it.
It's a shock.
and Muhammad One.
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not rocket can't be contrasted.
No one was validated by my mother and I didn't hire because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It just goes through accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of the present.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wanted to be disabled.
Let's go from walk.
You go out of Christmas -- you're in the mall center, drive in circles in search for parking parking and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And you think, "God, can I be at least a little bit disappeared."
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and Dr. C. It's just one of them.
So there was a opposite of oppression -- I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian and Muslim, women, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park Cherno, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initiatives.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
A lot of people with brain paralysis don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the can't.
The mantra of my father was, "You can make it -- dance song."
If my three older sisters.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would lead to the school system, and they were sure that I was also out of the school system, and if we didn't get all the maximum notes, we all got the shoes of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years by putting my hands on their feet and just walking.
Another tactics I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to pursue it.
The sign that I carry into was very strong and so on.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten garden was walking like a book camp that has received many balls.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs now, and they continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think about using "modernism to Muslims as a campaign.
The people I grew up with didn't have problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of concern that died of hunger during the Ramad.
I was telling you that I had enough fat to live three months out of it, so I will be able to get away from the dawn when I was very easy.
Baam took on Broadway.
Yes, in Broadway, it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with the cars, or I can walk with the cars.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends were using the cars, I too.
And when my friends were going to pass summer vacation on the coast of Jerusalem, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we don't go back to Palestine all the summer, we become Mahabue.
In summer, I often tried to get my father to try to get me, so I drank my deer milk and put me warm cups on the back, and I remember the water burned my eyes and I thought, "Well, work."
But the miracle cure was the yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before I made yoga was a state comedian that I couldn't stand on foot ...
And now I can stand on your head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the General Hospital Telescope.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the U.N., Aristotle State University because I walked in all the cases.
It was like the metropolitan limb of the theater department.
Everyone loved me.
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the maximum note in my classes and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal zone my teachers were crying.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the E.U. decided to do a work called Bankert very slow in Jackson very slow.
It's a piece of a girl with brain paralysis.
I was a girl with brain paralysis, I was a girl.
So I started to shout down the four winds -- "In the end, I will have a paper.
I have brain parallels.
Finally, at the fire end.
Thank God to modern God, I am a free."
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to Steve Brown.
I went to increase the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they believed that he couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Display, if I can't do the risk stunts -- you can't do the character.
It was a paper for which he literally had been born, and they gave it to an actress without brain paralysis, and they gave him a little bit of a brain parasite.
college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a short story of adding actors without disability for disabled paper.
By graduation, I went home, and my first active twist was like a television on a TV.
My dream became reality.
And I knew that he would be a chemical story to "Teacher Christmas in a sandwich.
Instead, I stayed there as a break, didn't see me more than the dark, and it was obvious to me that the report directors didn't hire rockets and not white, with disability.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Wolfram Goldman, Rose Barrel, Ella, and all these women had one thing in common: they were commercially.
That's why I became humor.
In my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comics that I took when I fell down in the account that I was going high speed by the New Jersey freeway, with a driver who had brain palsy parasites.
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no censor and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first monitor in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little disconnected rumor that says that women aren't fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the Feynman comedy Festival in New York City, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the American in the media and at the same time to remind them to the report director that South and Arabic are not synonymous and not simple.
Interviewed Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the design stigma.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like I was invited to the cable news program with Keith Olympic.
I walked into a graduation dance, and I was dragged into a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, "Display, can you give me another chair?"
She looked at me and said, "Six, four, three, two.
And we were live.
So I was clinging to the desk desk to not get out of the screen during the second, and when I finished the interview, I was pale down.
In the end, I had my opportunity and disappeared it. I knew they wouldn't get me back.
But not only Mr. Olympic went back to me, but I was going to be a complete time and my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith Oloon was that people on the Internet are school.
It's said that children are critical, but they never turned away from me or a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of banking.
I saw clips online with comments like, "Why does?
Is it return?
And my favorite police pollen is professionally.
What disease do you have?
We really should hear for it."
A comment suggested even to add my disability to my burner, guitar, combat, paralysi.
Disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't make Benjamin, then Benky can't make someone in wheelchair.
The disabled are -- yeah, clap -- yeah, man. Go!
Desperations are the largest minority in the world, and the most undergoologically undergoologically undergoologically in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think it was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Perhaps if there were more positive images, that would make less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Perhaps we still need all the society to teach our children.
My tribute has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to walk through the red carpet planted by the diet of the TV TV TV televisions and the blood Bleet Brazil.
I got to act on a film with Adam Sandy and to work with my dollar, the incredible Dave Matthewits.
It took the world in the world of the Arab have become crazy."
I was delicious for the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded "The Children of Mayan, a charity to give children refugee refugees a little sign of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting live, and I gave this talk to his memory.
[Silence, paper.
My name is Massachuse Zacker, and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
It lives in a little town to the South Somalia.
This village is near Madel.
The drought pushes the small village to poverty and on the edge of initiative.
No one for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, Madel, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, no future perspective.
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside of Madagascar.
After maybe one year, nothing.
A day is about a gentleman that offers him to take it to lunch, after dinner, to develop.
He knows a group of people who give him a deception.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, to his family.
They introduce a young guy.
Finally, it home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in Madago, under a blue sky, a car car.
That child from that little town with dreams of the great care was the suicide terrorist, and that dynamic group of people were to Shanghai, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him in the city with him.
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came to him.
This was the first thing that came out of what we call "the waiting period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the seals, young urban urban urban youth that display riots in Johnson, dissolve riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the hope period.
For young people, the city's promise of town, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of work, of work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the history of the waiting period, the deep door of terrorism, to the violence, to the panels, to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, Madel, 70 percent of young people are unexpected.
70 percent doesn't work, it doesn't go to school.
They don't exactly do anything.
I went back to Mahaburge last month, and I went to visit the marine hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in this hospital accelerating to balls thinking, and if I never would have been left?
What if I had seen me forced to be in that same spectrum of waiting?
Would I have become terrorist?
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in Madagascar that month was actually to adopt a few juvenile leaders in a corporate room.
He gathered about 90 Somali juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One guy in the room was Adam.
He went to the University of Madago graduated.
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because he was a graduate university, unexpected, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shah and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited to be recruited for.
They looked for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In Madago, the biggest obstacle to get to B is the streets.
Twenty years of civil war have completely destroyed the visual system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to move.
And they saw an opportunity and he caught it.
He started a motorcycle company.
It started pumping motorcycle to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
He bought 10 motors, with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expanding hundreds of miles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit -- and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against waiting period.
It photographed young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so desperately for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings Mountain, Mouar Moham, a flower.
I was helping me train some of the young people in the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mahaboest has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your wedding.
If you asked somebody, "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers from?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be, Never.
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of passion and floral design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of Madago, and he began to grow Tulights and liberals, which he said, could survive Madel climate furniture.
And it started the delivery of flowers for websites, creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies are now working on the creation of the first Public park in Madagascar in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Madago.
It wants to create a space where families -- young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial risks.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs that could be traditional about change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They identified corporate solutions for local problems.
So inspire young people and create a business of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need experience and orientation to guide them in the development and put out of their businesses.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, bringing them the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohmott is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park, this is how I call it, when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
He hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycle for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paradigm of waiting period.
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, you turn young people into entrepreneurs, they are bound and feeding their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Pakistan Parks than the cartoon and "speech series.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to play with my father in the Adurter Mountains an area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest forests.
The sun was making the leaves glow as a virtue, and not to be the path that we followed, almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings to spend that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a color in a river with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible ...
Behind the coverage there was a shark, about four feet square with adolescent apple balls of aluminum paper and old paper balls.
And I was announced, I was very angry, incredibly confused.
The fields that were too lazy to get out of what they had ever had, who thought it was going to clean their farmers?
That question followed with me, and it was simplified a little bit.
Who clean our basis?
No matter how they organize or where they put our own, who clean our trash in Sharmers?"
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or London?
Here in New York, the Department of Health clean up our trash -- at the reason of 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that charge?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through their trajectories and interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an insurgent.
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a trash collection.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I drive them.
And I was operating the mechanical schools and bars the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everyone asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as premise as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one is used quickly.
It costs a lot to get to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept adding to the weight of taking over their body tons of trash every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Office of World statistics, waste collection is one of the ten most dangerous occupation, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and walking into the traffic all day and pass around with you.
They just want to go, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is filled with dangers that often fall out of the truck and provide terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the room, and you see a city from the back of the truck, you can understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
He never stopped coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And there's also the stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is especially ironic because I think the waste collection is the most important workforce in the street streets, for three reasons.
They're the first public health protection.
If you don't get rid of waste in an efficient and effective form every day, this starts to get rid of your container and your inherent dangers threaten us in very real ways.
diseases that we had control for decades and centuries come back to outbreak and start to give us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the engine engines start to fail when it's in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed of the daily speech.
And I mean just to the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't worry, we don't repair or clean or take our coffee cup and our football bag, our bottle of water.
We use them, we throw them, we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will get rid of it.
So today I want to suggest a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost literal.
They're on the street every day, a retrospective way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you wait.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us away from ourselves from our own waste, our own waste, our waste, and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the spark of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I pulled down the stairs running, and there was a man doing his journey of paper recycled as all the Wednesday mistakes.
And I tried to thank you for doing her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just sitting, and he said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be fine."
And shortly after that, I started researching the collection of waste and went back to that man.
It's called Paul, we worked together and we did good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to figure out how we exist on this planet as a species we should include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost in the workforce of labor.
The municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about trash represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of his days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean the garbage of you, just a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life by forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the local conditions and traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Adults Abed.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we had to design about.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out and run out."
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to resist.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the crystals are generating heat inside the interior, so you need a lot of cooling in.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the year.
And third, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame by treating a place that is so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really categorized with the ancient market that is this free air structure where thousands of people go and buy things every day to small marketers every day.
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by inspired the site, which is located in a very growth area in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we created a connection between these two streets, using all the entries of the building.
And this extends with a little bit of an included attack that creates a free air space in the building that are automatically, by its own shape, the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responded to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a personal concrete configuration to allow the input of the air, but in a leaked way.
We then inspired ourselves in these beautiful buttons of the Ethiopian students.
They have fractal geometry properties, and it helped me model the fat.
We're building that with these little favorite pieces that are the windows that allow you to pass the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is completely filled with these little color crystals that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. It wasn't what we asked."
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because at the end of the day, there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but also because it didn't need to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve power self-destruction for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting photographers on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with meeting areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these pictures on the roof, which is a set of water collecting water for the health health.
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so large, the biggest I've designed -- I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis put a special attention in the middle, a 1,000 year-old structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these patents.
In addition to that, we selected some strategic points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this made the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project as the apartment as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in medical climate climate?
And it's northern, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore natural ventilation.
So we had a framework that sure that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with patents, and then on the lower plant, we have all the connections for the pedestrians at the bottom.
And it also responds to local norms that make a greater density on higher levels and lower density on the bottom plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like retrovirable the community occupied by construction.
It's where all neighbors, they can climb and select, and make activities like running a two miles a morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and economies at the same rate growing the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple but affordable solutions, which improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable as you see all new girls.
I had great amounts of hair very bright and a little standard of pencils, cute -- it was strong supported for the capitals of states, very good for organization.
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I brought my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the school. I was a little bit late and I hid on the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was slow, I went out in the classroom, I took the table of my teacher the calendar book.
And then I did.
I hold the ratings of my rivals, just a little bit, just a few things.
So all of them.  And I took my book back into the book, but to see some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a front, I ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows of God and myself a row of it, just for being there, because I could.
I still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I didn't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me.
It was all desperately obvious.
They never found me.
But most of all, it strikes me the reason why I was bothered that this little girl, so small, was so good for organization.
And I'm intrigued with the cells.
They're so mysterious and so performance.
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. The blue birds are very proper.
We know that cells are the number one cause of childhood murders in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzes the loneliness or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novel is like the laboratory in which the cells are studied in all their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no Helen the ice, no "Days?"
There would be no blood king or "The Thourist and One Network."
There would be Shakespeare.
They would disappear the high school reading lists because we would be losing "The noise and the Furry," there would be no "Gateson or "Friday," we will lose "Massachum Bonobo," and Anne K."
No cells, no Prototype." I know it's fashionable to say that I had the answers for everything, and in terms of milk, almost you have them.
This year is about 100 years of his masterpiece, "Looking at the lost time, the most exhaustive study of sexual cells, and also the ordinary competition, of mine, all we could have.  And thinking in Project, we have the sensory details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a humiliated manual in the laboratory.
We forget how hard that image.
We forget about how remarkable it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia Whole said were as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat of cat is like, but we assume it's surface.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the cheeses, the cells and Protocol.
Is it going to be very obvious as the cells who are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their impressions, are a good narrative about it.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel cells.
When we feel cells, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the same time and audience, we know exactly what details to include the knife, right?
The cells make us all autonomous novels, and that's something that I Proust understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And he starts to say to himself that story, and since then, I Proust it says that every single crazy thing that Swedeshest detects in his lover, he adds to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that Sweden and Proto, they were notoriously cheese.
You know, the November Novembers would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so cool to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
The cells are allegiances.
It's a hungry emotion. You have to feed it.
And what are the phones?
The cells are nutritively nutritional from information.
The cells use the details.
The cells like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute and small standard of peace.
The cells are nutritively nurtured from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  I set up the language with the language with the cells.
When South is in his peanut zone, suddenly listening behind the doors and sounds to the services of his lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is representative, but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or to look at a monster."
He says, "You're scientific research with real intellectual value.
I was trying to prove that the cells look implemators, and they make us seem absorbed and they make us seem absurd, but in their mind, they are knowledge of knowledge, a real real truth, a painful truth -- in fact, what I found to be aware of the more painful, the better the truth.
The pain, the humiliation, the loss, these were the pathways to the wisdom of Proto.
He says, "A woman whom we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a much deeper range of feelings and vital men than a wise man that can be interested."
Is it telling us that we're going to look for cruel women.
No, I think it's trying to say that the cells reveal ourselves.
And is there any other emotion that makes us open in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion reveals our agriculture, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intense intensity so precision?
Freud writing about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very inexpensive young man who was consumed with the idea that his woman was put down.
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, who didn't look at what his wife was doing.
Well, she was income, everybody knew that.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he looked for things that he did his wife, without realizing involved behaviors.
Does it smile too much, or accidentally do this access to a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the substance of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the cells make us look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intense we are, the more we become fantastic residents.
And for this reason, I think, the cells lead us to make violent or illegal acts of acts of it.
The cells drive us to behave in completely immediate ways.
Now I'm thinking about me when I was eight, I recognize it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years old, he was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that was sent by violent messages to himself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to instill the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend -- I have to confess that when or this, they reacted with admiration as well.
Because, let's be realistic.
What huge, although unfortunately, creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
It's like a novel from Patricia Himilos.
Himilos is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of "Exposed on a Tree, and "The Talemisha Mr. Replica," books that try to how the cells -- confused our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the brain realm, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be predatory in a moment.
Take Tom Replica, his most famous character.
Tom Replica is going to want or want what you have to get away from your self and get away from what you ever had, and it's under the floor. It responds to your name, take your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom Replicator.
I can't give you all the world, as much as I would sometimes want to.
It's a pity, because we live in time.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, are we good citizens of social networks, where the currency is the investment? Right?
The novels show us the sales? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not safe when you're in a mystery.
Let's go to 222 of Baker Street and ask for Sherwin Hollywood.
When people think about Holocausts, they think about the curse in the Morality professor, that criminal genius.
But I've always preferred -- "The Stereo Institute, the Rosetta Yard rat of the Saturday Yard rat that needs Hollywood desperately needs Hollywood genius, but he bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so familiar to me.
Teste needs its help, but it resists, and boring with March in the fall.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Single Nappington adventure once Hollywood comes in, it swims all with his solution, Selectable comes back to Holoys and says, "We are not cells, Mr. Holoys.
We're proud of you."
And he says there is no person in Scottish Day who would not want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see Holly transferred in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the cells as a geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute Holes is the opposite side of Lester.
The next minute are the same side.
All of a sudden, Lester allows you to admire that idea of being his research.
Could it still be so simple.
What if the cells are really an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to feel from the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like the management plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction to comfort us.
Only the fiction is deconsider the cells.
The fiction used the doctors, invite them to the table.
And look at what agriculture -- the Delhi sweet, the terrible Tom Replica, the crazy Sweden, the very March Project.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of the Apollo cord of Apollo 11 and described about the Maria Sea.
Armstrong and Alex were alone, but their presence on the moon surface gray was the culmination of a confused collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobility in the history of America.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo Programmer programs, 24 men traveled to the moon.
God walked on their surface, of which Alex after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest one.
So why were they?
They didn't make a lot of the back, 38 pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 discovered later, a new sense of the small and the fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in 1962.
John F. Kennedy -- some ask, why is the Moon?
Why to turn it into our goals?
And you could also ask, why do you climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain, the highest mountain, the highest.
35 years ago, why flying on the Atlantic?
Why do I play Rice against Texas.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Pongy, for contexts, the Apollo wasn't just a West victory on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the transition of the transformation of the power of technology.
They were because it was great to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long technological triumph list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the police was eradicated and the smallpox was eradicated.
Technology seemed to show what Alvin Tortucher in 1970, called "awarded force."
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship ship -- but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles a hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has evaporated when we see that technology would solve like going to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding global population seem to be intriguing results.
I remember looking at the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he doesn't look at the escape tube called the Saturn Saturn.
I knew that this would be the last standard mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what happened to our ability to solve problems with technology, has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologies would have been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhone, apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the automated path.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a partial explanation in Silicon Valley, who is confident that they have created less ambitious companies that those of the years that were funded in Intel Internet, Microsoft, Apple and General.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the burners, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to business.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of transformative ideas by financial problems and even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their long point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
The C.R. always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long term. They have never invested in developing technologies that are intended to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and biomass -- less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the biomass.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price. They don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what policies and international treatment would increase development of alternative energy, most of a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate today that we're going to see an energy policy of America or international treatment that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from the time that famine is a result of failure in the food department.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the food distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or systems for storage and food standards, but there will be famine while there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes have a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant training of treatment, and only over the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have been presented, political leaders and population should want to solve the problem: institutions must support the solution -- it should actually be really about a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, is with those criteria.
But it's a profit model in the future.
We're not in 1965.
There is no blood competition like in the Cold War, there is no policy like John Kennedy that supports the difficult and the dangerous thing, and there's no popular mythology of fiction fiction like to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't lack the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by reminding you the widespread ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become clear of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a record, there's been a great decline of trust, is a very pervasive belief.
The second is an objective, we should have more trust.
And the third is a task -- we should recover trust.
I believe that the receptor, the goal and the task has become wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a receptor, a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
So first the record, why do people think trust has disappeared?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I am inclined to think that it may have been disappeared in some activities or institutions and that might have increased others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can resort to the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has disappeared.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were discovered 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to inspire the same disaster.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be pretty reliable -- judges.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen in the street is almost about half the road.
But is this enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you record?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifest when they ask certain questions.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Do you trust the real?
Do you trust the fisheries?
Do you trust the elementary teachers?
You probably start to ask, "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to devote trust in a different way.
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain type of officer, function or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain primary teacher I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my most crazy friend to keep a conversation, but not, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why do we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to change the good inherent judgment to the fact that they rely on something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal I'm going to do.
I would argue to have more confidence in what's wrong with trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a part of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who dependent on their savings with the very closely called Mr. Madelli, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too confident.
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
Confidence or denied with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, it says, yes, it's worth that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment about how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are you competitive? Are you honesty? Are you responsible?
And if you find that one person is competitive in the permanent matter, and it's responsible and honest and so we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competitive and honest, but I wouldn't trust them to take a letter to the mail because they're orbital.
I have friends who are very sure you can do certain things, but I see that I see their own competition.
And I'm very glad to say that I don't have many friends who are consistent and responsible but extremely unexpected.
If this is, I still haven't caught me.
But that's what we're looking for? Connection before trust.
Trust is the answer.
Conviction is what we have to judge it.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accounts of accounts for all sorts of institutions for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once talking to a party and said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper than the part of the party in it."
And we find the same problem in all of our public lives, and institutional life, that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee trustworthiness. And the evidence of trustworthiness. It's actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they make the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the parts, demanding them to make the characters, as we say.
I sure you all know similar examples.
All of that, all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more confident, and that things would be different if we try to be worthy of trust and transfer people that we are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the attitudes that are not done properly.
Third, task.
To call the task rebuild trust, it puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust -- ultimately, it's different, because we give it other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get up, usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to give up some dense evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, makes the ordinary people, the functions, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can give them back without giving explanations.
I take them up and give me the money, or they change me by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think that what we're seeing is not very hard to dissolve.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we have been forced for reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that imagination can be disappeared.
This separation has gone reduced, getting more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tarthous screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there were no barriers?
I started imagining how it would be.
First created this tool that is in the digital space, so that when the strong person against the screen, it transfers its physical body to picks.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of hands?
In the division of Michael Apples in Microsoft, along with my mind Catholic Beller, he redesigned the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a translated view with the depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As windows and archives have a location in real space, select them is as easy as taking a book from a shelf.
You can draw the book and take lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down from every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we entered the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
And surely, many of us will have bought and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual test on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device in the head or the translucent when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel them?
So what would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Timutancy and my collaborator Kevin Pole, we created this only physical pixel press.
This spherical magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
Similarities, what we did was we allowed gravity and control movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and mechanical and detectors.
And by programming the object, we release it from time restrictions and space, which means human movements can record and go back to play and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically corruptions and distance and the famous shots of Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like planets, physical movement, and unlike the monsters or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to disconnect from our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a gym for two years in Hungary, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to transfer to a school for athletes with all the passenger spending.
But my mother tiger said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer, like them.
After survival the Cultural Revolution, they created firmly that there was only a closed path to happiness, a safe and good job.
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer must start training from very young people to learn the accuses, so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
And so I wrote to the director of school and a radio program.
But no adults gave him the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends would support me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream would never be done.
It was, in the rest of my life, a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved for another vocation.
No one around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
I turned on the books.
(Music Computers, and San Channel -- "The Highten History: I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were forbidden in China, of course.
"The Good Earth is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not a conventional property. understood.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a replicator, "Howard to your father and mother."
"Honey," I said, "It's so different, and much better than opening."
So it became my tool to get out of this configuration of confusing and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave place to my habit of comparative reading.
I put a lot of perspective.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me from place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
Compassion reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Comparing and contract, it offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books.
You can treat people "Best Franklin, from Walter Islamic "John Adams, who were involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences.
For the crisis, the temptation is economic, politics and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they're all psychological prosthesis, lust, fear and social -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
"The path of Chuck Thurk Thomas Marshall, instead of losing me in translation. I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, that's through the translation that I realized that "Happy in Chinese means "supported "great" -- James."
And "Novemberge, in Chinese, literally means new mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feel alone or impossible.
Having a demographic dream really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered with.
I have come to believe that profit is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a described dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here today, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always show them up.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychologist clients.
I was a medical student in Berkeley psychology.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex went into the first session using valves and a Dutch tail, and he threw on the couch of my office he took off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so alternated.
My classmates had a promise as a first client.
And I got a window that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the pink stories that Alex brought to the sessions, I was easy to move the head as we were giving the solution.
"The Treeses are the new New New New Congo, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working afterwards, you get married after that, you have children after the death happens later.
For savanards like Alex and I had time.
But shortly after, my squad super-end was pushed to push Alex to talk about his love life.
I was residentially.
I said, "Of course, he's coming out with guys under his category, and he gets married with a hollow head, but it's not like it was married with him."
And then my super-end said, "You know, I don't know, but maybe it's married with the next one.
Also, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before he came out?
This is what psychologists call a "Paulty moment.
It was when I realized that the '60s are not the new 20.
Yes, people feel head after what they used to, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex a cause in their development.
This made 20 of Alex the perfect time, and we were wasting it.
So I realized that this benign kind of benign neuroscience was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and the future of vents all over the place.
There are 50 million landscapes in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody gets to adulthood without going before the 1990s.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the gardens here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with grandmothers, you love a vent, you remove the dream a week, I want to see. Okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments "Ah, that shape his life will have happened to when they have 30 and so on.
People from over 40, they don't train in panic.
This audience is going to be OK, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on how much money they will win.
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or they are coming out with their future partner.
We know that the brain ends its second and final phase of growth in its 20s and representations for adults, which means if there is something you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their 20s than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top at the age of 28, and things become complicated at 35 degrees.
The 20 are time to educate about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person who will become the person.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the vegetations are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the time of adulthood.
The researchers call the 20 and an extended adolescence at all.
The journalists are taking ridiculous names, like "Tunisians and "differences."
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a translation what actually is the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Berry said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think that happens when you give him palms on the head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your life?"
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart grandmothers, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't account -- I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as you start a race before the 30, it will be fine."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My 20s are for ended, and I still have nothing to see.
I had better blame the day I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the 20s were like the game of chairs.
They all run and they get fun, but then at some point around 30, they shut up the music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing on, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was 30?"
Where are the windows here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but they don't get wrong, risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 1990s, there's a huge pressure to the traits and so many of you start a career, pick up a city, choose a city, pick up a couple, and have two or three children in a much smaller period of time.
Many of these things are not compassionate, and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and strong to do everything in the age of 30.
The crisis of media age is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
A lot of transistors and rooms see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their 20, "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the vegetations are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma called Emma
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a woman.
As a cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which showed more temperature than ambition.
And despite living about 20 very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
He cried often in our sessions, but then she stood up herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came put his head on his legs and cried during almost all the hour.
He had just bought a new fortune for a principal, and he had spent the whole morning putting it up with his many contacts, but then he looked at the empty space that followed after the words "In Case, please.
And he was about the story when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have an autism accident.
Who's going to take care of if I give me cancer?
At that time, I got a lot of work to resist and not say, "Aye."
What Emma needed was not a therapy that was really worried about.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decades of Emma passed in front of it.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of the windows, man or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that it would forget about that identity crisis and get identity.
By identity, I mean doing something that I add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the Emma career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that interior, of that company that you want to test.
I'm not documenting the window explorer, I'm documenting the exploration that I should not say, that by the way, it's not exploration.
It's practice.
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are surveillated.
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the vents that meet with friends with similar minds are limited in how much they know what they know, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes from the nearest circle.
New things come from what are called weak little friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the vents have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way of persuading this group.
Half of the work created never published, so knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Finally, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a window, Emma soon to choose his family, when he has a partner and form his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit than 20 or even 25, and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live with now or you go back when everyone on Facebook starts walking towards the altar.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do, and that means being so interesting in love as you're at work.
Choosing your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with who it is that I pick them up to you.
So what about Emmanuel?
Well, we looked at that principal, and she found the roommate of a prime that worked on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend that he lived with.
Now, five years later, it is special organizations of events in museums.
This married with a man who chose consciously consciously.
I love her new career, I love his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now emergency contact spaces are not big enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with vents.
It's very easy to help them.
The vegetations are like planes coming out of the airport of Los Angeles, which come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the hill, a slight fit in your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or Scratch.
In the same way, at 21 or 25 to 25, a good conversation, a good conservation, a good TED talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even the next generation.
This is my idea of spreading all the vegetables that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex to Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege to tell you to servers like Emma every day, and the trains are not the new 20, they collect their adult, they get identity capital, they use their weak bond, they choose your family.
They don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in MRI for a job that was even more implicity."
I went to show you mathematics to graduate students in New York public schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and testing.
They give them tasks.
When the work came back, the grades.
What called me the attention was that C wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had no I.Q. scores of schools.
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh degrees -- sure, are hard, propositions, decent, the area of a paralysi.
But these concepts are not impossible and it was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years of documentary, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the C, but what if we have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of challenging scenarios and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the military Academy West Penns.
We tried to predict what chains would remain in military training and who would be redesigned.
We went to the National Deletery of Delegal and tried to predict what children would move from the most far possible in competition.
We study novel teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking you what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and those who are the most effective to improve the results of learning their students.
We partnered with private companies, asking ourselves, what about these marketers are going to keep their job point?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, a feature came up as an important prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and wasn't the C.
It was determining.
People are passion and perseverance.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to cling into their future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
Person is living life as if it was a marathon -- not a career to all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in Chicago public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my determination care and then wait around a year to see who they were graduated.
It turns out that the more determination children had significantly greater likely to graduate -- even when they put them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized tests, even security that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or at the National Delegal Project, where the determination is -- it's also in school, especially for children at risk of abandoning it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach children a solid job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long plate?
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you detergent.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly not related or is even related to the talent measurements.
Until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called a growth mentality.
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Doctor, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with effort.
Dr. Dodwagren has shown that when children read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to perceive when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop detergent.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to expand, to start all again with the lessons learned.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more determined.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a child, one of my most stressed memories is my mother showing the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a foreign one, it seems as improved as the Great World Current.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can take this market, so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and rapid learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw each of the tracks of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic, 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read traffic signals, restorations to understand the basic idea of websites or newspapers.
I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
They open their mouth as much as possible until it's square.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
Perfect.
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was screaming frontal, "Audience: I'm burned," this symbol is actually original of the shape of the call, but I like to believe that it's the other way. The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun sun.
The moon.
The source of the door looks like a couple of gates in the old West.
I call radical to these eight characters.
They're building blocks to create many more characters.
A person.
If somebody walks back, that's going to be close."
As the ancient said, two are company, three are multiple collapses.
If one person would stretch their arms, this person is saying, "It was this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is stuck.
It's a prisoner like Jones inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a "difference."  Easy to remember, because a paradox tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two fire together, it gets very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of calls.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burning.
For us, sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, present.
Three together, those are delays.
Put the sun and Moon shining together, that's the bright.
It also means morning, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon. And they get it.
A door. You put a table inside the door, it's the front of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
To touch play, is anybody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, escape, evaluation.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing them.
Three women together, they're careful is adult.
So we've already gone through 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical radiologists will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32 characters.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn an eight-year-old Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a volcano.
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin because Japan is in the eastern of China.
So one sun next to origami, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile. Because Chinese employers were destroying their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, the exile.
A mouth that tells you where you get out is a life.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down from the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad are the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Olympic magician together.
The film mastered its imagination for months.
His favorite character was Glentome, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic range.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial fuel of children's fantasy.
However, the Olympic magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a lot of years later with a lot of years later, interestingly, another film whose protesters, a metal boy and a hairy kid rescued a girl dressed as a guilt of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the Olympic magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Oz magician.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like apples.
But I think that if the Oz magician was done today, the magician would say, "Door, you're the Salman salvation as the product predicted it.
You use magic shoes to defeat the army computer-generated army of the evil barrel.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the Oz magician is that the most heroic characters, wise and even villages are women.
I started noticing this when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had come down.  So he woke up in the room and he was impressed as a mom legs with her patterns behind it, and I don't think he would understand what was happening, but inevitably, it absorbs everything.
I wonder what it was.
Would you be issues of value, perseverance and legal?
Would it be feeling that Luke joined an army to defeat the government?
We'll compare this with the 1930 magician of 1989.
How do I win your movie for it?
By making good miles with everybody and being a leader.
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow Olympic, okay? And not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital Faith, force in movies for our children, so little the yellow blues path, yellow blueprints.
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should read. It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this stimulus thing.
I know for experience that the Princess Law doesn't provide the right frame that I would have served to navigate the world of adults which is mission.  I think at the moment of the first kiss -- I really expected the credit to begin to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has done, I have neighborhood.
Why are they still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the violin and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventure.
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit to you.
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they send the kids, they're not really their objective public.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the pathologic, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the paralysi.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real as Berlin and Kansas -- but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all time continues to appear in classic after classical after a child, each of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who created a girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of Valti.
I recommend it to all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what the critic said when it came out Galvani?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a princess film.
It's very good. Don't let that stop them."
Well, almost none of these films happens the Bell test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet taken roots and it already spreads out, but maybe we will start a movement.
Stephen Bick is a comic drawing, and in the middle 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the assessment of the films that they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be done, in the movie, is there more than a female character than you have lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more apart from the guy that you like like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good film, Arabic.
Right? Shark Rush Rushes, a conservative idea of what a Hollywood movie movie is.
It is virtually not the Brectal test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an embassy where men and women hide during the refugees of the refugees.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this school, and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Are you going to bed, cartoon?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at numbers.
In 2011, the 100 most popular film, how many of them believe they have female protests?
Okay. It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that is going to describe this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music or pornography videos are closely linked but something wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sexual agencies.
Who are those guys, what are those kinds?
What don't you get to learn.
Are you looking at the story that you say that the role of a male hero is to defeat the violin with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and doesn't talk about?
Are we using that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our device as it would be possible, and we hope that it will help, but I have to ask, but I have to ask, but I have to ask, but I have to ask, but I have to ask you, but I have to ask you, but do I have to ask, but I have to ask, but I have to ask, but I have to
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of man.
The definition of machinery is radically changing.
You'll have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the stabilized.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character from Star Wars know what he responded with?
Worker.
Obama Kenned and Glas.
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress of dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like those kinds of stories for my daughter, and I like those kinds of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which you tell my son, and you see and fight only and more stories where your work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, help other people better improve and be better people, like the Olympic magician.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked the most was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine, because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these concents.
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I used to look for them.
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me collect them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the architecture.
And finally when I started studying electronics, I realized that seeing my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up to one of nearly 1,000 miles of length along the National.
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use infrared information.
This is a place in the eastern debt of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, a simple view, seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like bright pink room.
What you're looking at is real chemical changes that are caused by the construction materials and the activities of ancient Egyptians and electricity.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Islamic, lost for thousands of years.
Island was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire. About 4,000 years ago.
The place is in the Fabricador, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The Egyptians have always known that Islamic was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that built them in the top of the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge really blood plain.
This area is enormous, it measures about six percent per mile.
Before, the NSA flowed right next to the side of Islam, and as it changed over time, he moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a single city in an extensive landscape?
Trying to find it at the random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a passenger, with the eyes sent and using baseball gloves using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves
So we use NASA topographic data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the Nile flowers.
But you can see more detailed, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of Islamic.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing samples -- you can see it here.
When I say shown, it's like the sample of the ice, but instead of climate change, we look for human occupation layers.
Five meters down, under a thick layer of law, we found a dense layer of objects of ceramics.
That means that in this possible location of Islamic, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that date from the Middle Empire.
We also found working jobs, coral, culture and cattle, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop.
This might seem to be not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire, these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find Isaac here, but we'll go back to place in a near future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire.
sharing knowledge is the biggest of all vaccines.
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to it, TED wasn't founded in 1984 D. C.
They cause ideas really started in 1984 to C. in a city lost not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search of marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of the house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's done.
Now visualize a group of obese nurses in bicycle.
They're competing in a nuclear race of bicycles and they are going to address their entry door.
I need to see this really.
They're pulling strong, they are sweating, they are saving a lot.
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that go on to their side, flags of the wheels that end up in absurd places, and they pass the threshold of the door.
To the law, to the passion, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the bright light on the Monster of the Galloon.
He's waving them with your hand.
It was from his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue ball by doing it on the nose.
You can smell the oats. You can smell the store and you pass out that it's about to get into the mouth.
Walk on a side and enter their living room.
In the room, and doing maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney Spears.
It's with little clothes, dancing on his center of center, singing Hill Barbara A More More More Middle Air.
Now follow me to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of yellow brick and from the oven come to you Doubt, the Man of Photo, the Spain and the lion of "The Olympic Magic, grabbed from hands, jumping into you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the United States Memory.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, waiting for me, that this was like the end of a super-exposure supernova.
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages of hygiene.
They were memorize hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They memorize the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorize entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize the order of a deck of nanotubes.
And I thought, "This is amazing."
These people should be a phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Coak who had come from England and has one of the best trained memory.
I said, "Hey, when do you realize you were a knowledge?
Ed replied, "I am not a knowledge.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everyone who's involved with this competition is that they have normal memory.
"We have trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that China used to memorize their speech, and that medieval academics used to memorize entire books.
And my reaction was, "Oh, how did I not hear about this before?
We were standing out of the room of competition, and Ed who is a wonderful and brilliant English evening, although a little bit of exciting, he said, "John, you're an American journalist.
You know Britney Spears?
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney Spectrum how to memorize the order in a live named national board, on national TV.
That would test the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something right?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also research, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what its potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named E.
He is ambitious, very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a memory problem. It's amazing.
And somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim Peace. He was based on the role of Justice Hong in the movie "Rami Man."
We spent a afternoon together in the Salt Lake City public library by mixing phone books, and it was celebrated.
And when you go back, I read a lot of treated about the memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the ancient and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
And one of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having trained memory, discipline and culture was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we've also changed us.
We've changed culturally and I would say that they've changed us as well.
As we almost don't need to remember, sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of a trained memory, discipline and culture is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that singularing, there are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated. I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from the London College University invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
You wanted to know: Is it that it has brains in some way, structural or anti-political and anti-political different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the rest of it?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between the brain champions and the control subjects that they compare them.
When they put them into a magnetic MRI machine, they scanned their brains as they memorize numbers and faces and forms of snow coasts -- found that in memory champions were lit parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually used them, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive memory is running as an armed career where every year you see someone with a new way of remembering more things, faster, and then the rest of the competitors should be put a day.
This is my friend Ben Princeton, three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 beekeepers of messy nanotubes that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and she just mastered it.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 444 dial binary digits.
In half hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all of the techniques used at the end of the end are reduced to a single concept that psychologists call the collective collision."
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as "Pauling Bathroom, "But "Boys, I tell two people you remember the same word. I tell you that there's a man named Barrica."
That's her spider.
And then I ask them, "You remember there's a battle battle."
And when I go back later, and I ask them that word that I told you a reason for a return?
Remember what it was?
The person who told her that their name is Baraka is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said his job is bathroom."
Same word, different capacity of memory, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Bank, it doesn't really mean anything for you.
With all the other memories that you remember in your head.
But the word, "Blue -- we know pants.
They use silent white hat.
They have hands in their hands.
They're okay when they go home to work.
We probably know some pantress.
And when we first hear that word for the first time, we started putting approaches to particularly pick them up at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data is about 2,500 years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's known as the paper of memory."
The story says this: There was a poet called Similarity who attended a bank.
They had hired it as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring a DNA, it was hired to a poet.
He stood up, he received his memory poem, and he was shooting, and so soon he was gone, the basketball room collapsed out.
killing them all.
But not only killed them all, but it destroyed the bodies by giving them irresponsible.
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
And so they couldn't bury the bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
Symphony, standing out of it, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble screens, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every invented.
I took the families in the hand by taking them where their loved beings were been loved between the rubble.
What Symphonic argued at that moment is something we all know more or less intuitively, and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space.
If I asked you to get the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Symphony, it's very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who was sitting on the horse past brown in their lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of memory that memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy it is sported, it is for free, black, block and suspension is the image, more inevitable to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in Latin, Latin treaties.
And how does it work?
Let's say that you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that China would have done if you were invited by TEDx 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And you can figure out some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and unpredictable image to help you remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely intellectual competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the monster of the Galapagos Mounter on Missous Ed on the Monterey.
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed Coke.
And then you would see Britney Spears to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they would go into the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talked about would be that strange journey that they did for an entire year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is how romantic speakers memorize their speeches -- I wouldn't word for word, which is going to confuse them, but typical typical play.
In fact, the Trecap term comes from the Greek "Cow -- which means "play" that means "play" ...
It's a veterinary of when people thought about the orange and the rhetoric with these species of spatial terms.
The phrase "first place, would be like the first place in your memory palasiti.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory competitions, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this sub-generating submarine suburbs.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a particularly boring event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking stories -- I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is massively married.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in these people, but I don't have access to it.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school old school bought in a thumb market.
And I discovered that this was surprisingly entertaining.
He would never have expected it to be.
It was contrasted, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous, common images, promises, instant, anxiety and intense eyes, in the eye of mind.
I was pretty pleased with this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of ears and a couple of security glasses with tape leaving only two holes, because the distribution is the worst enemy of a memory competition.
I ended up coming back to the same contest I had covered a year earlier. I had the idea that I could go in, in a kind of participatory journalism experiment.
I thought this could serve for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition -- something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute to be able to memorize speech, and phone numbers, and shopping lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build palesters of memory or memorize names of names.
We often talk about people with a big memory as if it was an innate gift -- but it's not the case.
Great memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we focus deeply.
The paper palace -- these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even real shortcuts.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep process, a complete kind of attention that most of it is not going to go through there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
This is how things are made memory.
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today, it's what Elehand, the ambulance I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short existence in Blackberries or iPhone, not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walks our side. Are we going to be so tapirs that we don't even bother to process in deep?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you should be the kind of person who remember remembering remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so we're going to address just a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from New Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' home in a village called Liberia, and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a basketball that was giving the living room.
And there all happened to be looking at the telly -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody would see me, and every time I went back into a towel and I went back into a towel -- everybody looked at me.
And I was like that.
It was torture, insecure and hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that ball, hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Listen.
Those feelings -- those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or zones of zones, but of those visceral connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we do.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice us.
That makes us little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you do with you: you think about power, "the "standing" and democracy."
And I know that you think about it like this for based on a building and built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a design that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable soldiers, solid soldiers, in front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build the urbanisms and the governments, they always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Public Library of Liberia that ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a company -- it has this round, collaborators, red brick -- that let you interview what Liberia is trying to communicate with this building, the children, the property values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library was done, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries -- are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of peak.
On one side there is innovation, architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for today's life.
We shared, we push and push so much, we completely get away from people.
Everybody in black, this depressed us, you think we feel very well, but we're dead in the inside because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and go back to connect with those adverse symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like transportations, so we start to experience again, we make it down to the back of the back forward, over over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, we went out of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called brutality.
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
Small windows in a disabled scale.
Something really hard.
So we got closer to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We push the pendulum back into the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know that we like and we do it.
We added new and added cake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give you a chance.
We take China arms and turn them into races, which can be medieval passions made of glass.
The forms were killed, they won in bold and color.
The engineers became columns themselves.
The ones grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the moment in commercial centers, we move into the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasy.
Those fantasies could be to the Mediterranean, the French or the Italian, or the Italian, or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or the Italian or
Probably with a loaf of bread.
This is what happens with policy.
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we remember memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the Touchrica.
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum back into the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called democracy.
We download the historical symbols -- now we have new design techniques of design, and we find new compositions, some ways that are star against other ways.
This is academic and embryonic, and it's super implant: you get totally excluded.
Normally, the peaceful penalty again in opposite direction.
But then something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Guiza of Billie, from Frank Georgia.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Globali said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and academics and public in general were completely agree on a building.
The New York Times made this miracle construction.
The tourism in Bilbao increased in 2,500 percent when the building ended up the building.
So, all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those buildings, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Serbia.
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these shapes and wild and radical, how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and turbulence.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the major mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and transparency.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennia happened with other star architects.
I went to Zacky and Liberia, and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all the architecture, the digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
The transportation is accelerated: they can take a boat, an airplane, they can be turbles.
The technology accelerates -- you can see in the newspapers, on the telly -- and at the end, we are all architectural photographers, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't cost a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know whether that designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
Brutality was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they were stopping them.
That's never going to happen -- I think, because we're in the threshold of the greatest revolution in architecture from the invention of the mountain, the steel or the elevator and the revolution of the media.
My theory is that when you apply permission to the media of communication, it starts to do faster and faster, until you get in both extremes almost in simultaneously, and it is effectively destroyed the difference between innovation and symbol between us, the architects and you -- the public.
Now we can do almost instant symbols, with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that came up.
This is the center of a village called Pinnas at Fire Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the final product, there was no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a media of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes concrete memory with the collective memory, and when you charge these symbols.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell you what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those Library library.
If that building is built today, we first go to the Internet in search for new libraries.
We would be bombarded with examples of experimentation.
That's manipulations.
Manipulations that can lead to the mayor of Liberia, people in Liberia, and tell you that there is no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use giant words and complicated drawings and one is no longer a destroyed public that doesn't accept something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't let the architecture.
That means the standard pendulum from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that tomorrow buildings will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Sevent can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick with ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because eventually we're ready for the forms that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are attached to nature carbon and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or for yoga or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East River of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of reforms, as muscle and fiber as the animals that are going to look at.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more ecological buildings, more intelligent and more amazing.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
They find an architect, hire it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, but they give it way to the smallest spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the downtown to bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Starbo.
I just turned a year and started walking.
And he does it that great, typical way of the kids of a year, and the trade-off, as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that he likes to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and film, and it gives itself these big and wet kisses itself.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do this, and he made me think, when did you stop doing this?
How are we suddenly not going to be at the point of our approach?
Because, apparently, we don't like.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google, "Am I faith?
This is Fay, he's 13 years old and lives in Dene.
And like any teenagers, it just wants to be loved and fit.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells her all the time that is beautiful, every day at school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells her, and what his friends, or school partners say, doesn't know who to believe.
So it makes a video from himself, I published it on YouTube, and I ask others to please please leave a comment, "Am I beautiful or fail?
Well, until now, Fate has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so disabled, that it doesn't even deserve the nightmare to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal and current teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it bringing them to do this?
Well, today's teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online, and available all the time, talking, charge, saying, "I like them, starting, publishing, publishing, this never ends.
Never before we have been so connected in a continuous way, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room every night.
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are impossible.
This environment, of being always connected, is adding our kids to catch on the number of "I like to have and the kinds of comments they get.
There's no division between a live online and life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what's real or what isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is digitally manipulated.
What is the most passionate thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are you looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cut from the news of the girls now.
Zero stem models continue to dominate our passengers.
The engineering technique is now a routine now.
And trends like, "the disaster, a discourse, the biological and the profit.
For those of you who recognize it, it means prepared.
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are compared to you.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the super-edge stars in the sports and the remote singers of the sport.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow healthy and be well-engineered individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and others start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see enough enough.
These are not trivial activity.
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as contributions to society and to the labor development camp.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class arguments, they avoid to participate in classrooms because they don't want to call the attention for their physical appearance.
One out of five are not attending class at all, when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you see you enough enough, especially if you don't think you're thin enough, you will get a lower note to the average of your peers who don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland and United States and China.
And it gets irrespective of what these young people actually weigh on.
So, to be very clear, we're talking about how you see you, not of how you are.
The low self-esteem on his body is changing academic performance.
And it's also drawing health.
The senior teenagers are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more people not healthy than they can bring them to a food mess.
They have low self-worth.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them and they are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what they make decisions more risky, like alcohol consumption and drugs, dramatic diet -- aesthetic surgery, sexual surgery, sex relationships at early ages and without protection and autonomous damage.
The search of the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe they have super-end again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher gas rates.
17 percent of women are not presented to a work interview in a day where they don't feel safe with how they look like.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity.
So release this potential is in the interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes. The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good programs, without realizing the situation is worse.
So, we must make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
And these six aspects are crucial participation points for anyone to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but we will face this problem requires each of us to take the address in the issue, and we're a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count with the approach of our politicians in hair cuts or the size of its chest, or to urge that the determination or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty of it.
We need to start judge people so they are, not as they look like.
All of us can start by doing it by taking responsibility for the kinds of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can praise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you were kissing a mirror?
In summary, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow up by valuing their entire person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the inclusive.
We have to put people who are really making the difference on a pediatrician.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that go out on the big screen, because we will only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they think they can never get them from being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who have in mind?
Is to their wife, right?
Your sister here?
A daughter to his daughter.
Your sounds) Is he friends?
Could it just be the woman who is two seats. What would it mean for her if he was released from that authentic voice in its interior, that he has been able to have long legs -- more thin legs, a more flat stream, smaller feet.
What would it mean for her if we overcome this and we would say it reduces its potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is getting us all.
But let's teach our children the truth.
Let's show you that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and they make us feel.
We include self-esteem.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we work together like a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small trails of a year of today, become an agents of safe change in the same morning.
Let's do it.
On November five in 2009, a gentleman named Embassier Norman entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, Mr. Kafikan leader, the leader of Defense Judail.
Now Israel initially declared it, but being pressure for other charges minor in company, they started planning attacks to about 12 cents in New York City, including tunnels, synapses and the headquarters of the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans were frustrated by a FBI.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center could not be avoided.
Later, Norwegian would be convicted by its participation in that bombing.
English Norman is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an Egyptian engineer, with a lovely American mother, a prime school teacher, between the two made all the possible for giving me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims -- they get to know.
By experience, I saw that when people take time to interact -- it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion in all human groups, there is always a little fraction of people who are being so hardware to their convictions that they think you have to use all the possible media so that everyone lived like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat up with me and explained to me that in the last few weeks, he and some friends had been going to throw on Long Island, to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We got to the polio point of the California that, without knowing our group, was visited by the FBI.
When I was playing, my father helped me holding the rifle. And I explained to me how to point to the goal at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot I gave the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all of all, especially me, all of the goal is in fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said "I would go out of "I have "Oh "Oh Buddhist."
From such a parent, such child.
At all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted by putting a carrying set of 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and killed another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them "memory," which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of friends.
Every time he started feeling comfortable near somebody else was time to empathize and go to another city.
As I was always me the new face of the class with frequency was killing data.
It was secret by my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of class, silence and region, was enough ammunition to be manipulation.
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to say it summer, to grow under favorite, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was educated to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race or religion.
So how could I open your eyes?
One of the first experiences that came to test my way of thinking was during presidential elections of 2000.
In a university program that I participated in the June National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group focused on the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been killed by almost all of my life, it was something that felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different backgrounds.
One day, at the end of the convention -- I discovered that one of the kids who we had made friendship was Jewish was.
It took several days out to light this detail and realized that there was no animation between the two.
Never before I had had a Jewish friend and frankly felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life had been believed that it was incredible.
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush Gardens a lot of fun.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures, and that experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had been taught that homosexual was a sin and by extension, all the worms were bad influences.
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with homosexual actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most amazing and less critical and less critical I had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat any kind, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is like to be honeybee, but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the Dalai Show.
Every night, Jon Stewart made me intelligently honest about my injustices, and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my patent figure at a moment when I was desperately needed to.
In fact, inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, extremism, wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I would preserve in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of someone who has suffered enough with international dominance and said, "I'm tired of hating."
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not Zam Brazil.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put it into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope someone, one day, who is trying to lead violence, can hear my story and understand that there is a better path, which even though I was led to this violent and elevated ideology -- I didn't get to me faithful.
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against preparations.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts of no sense, as a rejection to my father's actions.
So with this simple I'm exposed here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents' roads.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that projects in your minds.
It's an amazing multi-touch movie.
It's in 3D and it has surface sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a shark, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like the moments of your childhood that are projected to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice on your conscious thinking stream.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in the direction.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of being human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know I have a conscious consciousness.
I don't have any certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal movies.
Why are we not just robots that we have to produce the results without experiencing the internal movie.
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science is objective.
consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, I press that vision.
Psychologists studied behavior objectively, neuroscience studied the brain objectively, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then, 20 years ago, everything started to change.
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Prospera said, "Now is the moment for science to adopt consciousness.
And since then, there was a real bang, a flow of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations until the moment.
The center of consciousness of consciousness in recent years was the search for correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kansas presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science science.
It's not an explanation science.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
So I'd like to explain this by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do some brain areas and what they correlate with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense of neuroscience.
There are actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the real central mystery of this matter, why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a subjective internal movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like embryonics, like hurricanes, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical events are all cases of emerging behaviors, how the embarrassments operate how the hurricane works, how the hurricane works, how they reproduce and they metabolize living organisms -- all of these questions about objective work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon, how we walk, how we talk about, how do we play chess -- all of these questions about behavior.
But when it's about consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here is, the standard paradigm of the emergence -- the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't really have a lot to say.
I am a scientific material material.
I want a scientific theory of autonomy that works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we get stuck at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanation, great. We used this: physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains the part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I believe that consciousness, right now, is kind of an anomaly, something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know yet.
With an anomaly, like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first seem crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what you need to do, is to explain the objective functions of the brain, the brain behaviors -- and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reducing consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promises.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental brains, space, time and mass.
They put fundamental laws that govern them, like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explained in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, they consider fundamentalists, and from there you build the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is all over.
In the 19th century Macedergeting discovered that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- pressure space, time, mass law, and then I put the basic laws of electronics, and I put the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws government.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas of ideas, space space, time, mass market, so for a matter of logic -- you have to run the list.
The most natural thing would be positive as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the path to make it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can kill them in a nerve.
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can kill them in a t-shirt.
We don't still know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called parasite, "Pauloty for mind, particularly psychotherapy, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob King microbes -- the elementary particles.
Even a picture has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or they think.
It's not that a picture can be full of angry when he thinks, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the robots.
No, so no.
But the thought is that maybe the photons can have some kind of crude feeling, subjective self-assembly, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How do anybody think something so crazy?
Some of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass -- is natural to assume that it can also be universal, like the others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems illegal, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to the physical process, is linked awareness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there's awareness.
complex information processing as a human being, complex consciousness.
Simple information processing, simple awareness.
So something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, Gillian Tongue, took this kind of theory and development with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called the chip, which measures the degree of information in a system.
And I suppose I have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of grass, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an average degree of information integration -- the same very meaningful degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the woman, microbes -- particles -- the degree of chips they say.
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In Toney, there will still be a different level of consciousness.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness, high degree of photo, high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that paradigm can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equation, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlies below.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire of equations come from?
From the passenger vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists basically do describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, the consciousness is the one that makes it fire.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of addiction.
It's right there at the center.
This vision -- I think, the paradigm vision, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious social consequences.
Some can be slightly.
I used to think that I should not eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a grandmother.
If you're a paradigm and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think that thinking about it, this tends to transform your visions while what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences, is not so much the fact that consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems like computers.
What about the Arguist artificial intelligence system, in the movie "How?"
Is it conscious?
According to the vision of paradigm information, she has a complicated information process, integrated, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you get pretty serious ethical problems on the ethic of the development of intelligent computer systems and the ethics of bringing them off.
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of complete collective collections, the planet.
Do you have its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience on a TED Talk, right now we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole TED group, different from the internal movies of each other part?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that needs to be serious.
So this vision parasites, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more secure than the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that the second thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we'll finally find it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in victory.
I had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to get to the community of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She has not actually gotten anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on my mother's wig and spent a lot of time looking at Buddhist The Vander Salamander, and Davids Create."
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school of Melanity, just after about 20 minutes on the 11 class of legal studies a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when do you give you your discussion?"
I said, "What did I disappear?"
Well, I had been telling you about the law law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation speech.
When people in wheelchair, talk about inspirational things in school?
"Of course, in the action room.
And this was when I realized, this boy had had experiences with people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we are. And it's not a blame of the guy, that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manipulations.
We're not real people. We're there to inspire you.
And in fact, I'm on this stage looking at what I do in this wheelchair and you're probably waiting to inspire you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to describe them.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to the disability of disability.
Yes, you have sold the sense that disability is something wrong, and to massive, My massive machine.
It's a bad thing and living with a disability that makes you exceptional.
It's not bad and it can't make it exceptional.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or this one: "Your excuse is invited." In effect.
Or this one: "Before you go, interrogate."
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the hands without hands drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the porn term deliciously, because they challenge a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we are doing the design of the benefits of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, to motivate them, so that we can see them and think, "Well, very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But what if you're that person?
And I've lost the account of the number of times that I have been strangers on trying to express that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this happens before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was happy to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is to cost it.
These images, those images actually make people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so that you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
We overcome some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term "performance," deliberately because I subscribe to the so-called speed model of disability that tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that we live that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him.
I do the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to take the best of its ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to make them in the way we do it, as we share those pictures?
When people say, "You're a source of inspiration -- it says it as a completely.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because we've sold this sense that disability makes us exceptional.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here born inspiration and you think, "My God, Starbuza, aren't you sometimes inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
I learn from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
I learn that this is a great idea to use a few pieces of wire to pick up the things that are falling down.  I learn the ingenious trick of how to load the battery on the chair of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that exceptional and costs.
I really believe that that lie that you've sold about disability is the greatest injustice.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude, the reason that that is lying is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a scale of stairs has never done it into a rahman.
Never.   Synapse before a television screen will not make the subtitles.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and making a positive attitude to turn all those books into the bright.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching Buddhist the Vander Star is not considered no deserve for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are happy to get us from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree boy in a high school of Mellon is not a little surprising that his new teacher is a wheelchair user user users.
Disability doesn't make us exceptions, but to question what you believe to know about it, I know it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to do with augmented reality and professional football with empathy.
And what is the average speed of a widespread golden gallery?
Unfortunately, today I just answer one of those questions, so please don't describe.
When people think about augmented reality, they think about "Minister Republic, and Tom Cruzza giving hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to augmented reality?
The first step, this is what I carry on, the Google Googles Galvaors.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google Glass is a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll let you experience what is a professional sports in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what it is to run through the game field at 160 miles, blood beating the ears.
We can know that a 100 pounds man is chasing us, trying to wake up with all its being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I bring some videos to show you what it is to use Google Glass, under the helmet and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the NASA practices because the idea of the NASA of emerging technology is a submarine coming up on the surface, but we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Kold, go.
It's horrible to be sliced.
A moment. Let's zoom a little bit.
You ready?
Go!
Chris Kold, as you can see, is a protection of what is being touched in the football field, from the perspective of the slice.
You may have realized that it's missing people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, curious at the University of Washington.
The field Mariostorty, mice 54: mice 54: Radios.
Blue eight, Blue 8 -- let's go."
Chris Kold, this is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at NASA.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and have asked me on YouTube and on Twitter, you can see from the angle of a field marine.
From a rice?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we get out of full, how do we take it to the next level.
We take it to that level using something called October Ritten, which surely many of you already know.
The Hall Rick has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap words.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh.
No, no, no, I don't want to keep playing. No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a roller mountain afraid for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we recorded a video of Adrian Peters crossing the line, taking off a slate with the arm before running and doing an antibiotics: What will be the experience of a fan.
Is it Mexican running out of the shark, washing the ball on the bottom of the network, or Federal doing a shelter in Williams?
What will your experience be when it descended from a mountain to more than 100 miles as a Olympic scanner?
Maybe you increase the sales of pales for adults.
But this is not even augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, Rwanda.
How do we achieve augmented reality, RS: Right?
We will reach the augmented reality when the coaches and the manufacturers and the owners see what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams.
How do we use it to win parts?
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher about the technology at NASA.
In 1965, the Baline Pots put a wrist to his field marijuana to play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NASA placed radio in the cartoons of the field of the field and then in the defense.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2003, imagine that they're a player coming back to their group, and you see their next player shown in front of you, in a plastic view that you carry on -- you don't have to worry about forgetting a game.
Or to memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose parts.
If you lose parts of you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual of improved strategies.
The augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would it be done?
Well, a very simple choice would be having a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from how high people are down.
You also get information from the sensors and the accelerations, something that's already working already.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know to send it.
The bad ones will have information.
This would differentiate the good teams of bad equipment.
So, your computer team will be as important as your records, and the data analysis will stop being just for neurons.
It's going to be a professor. Who would have imagined it?
How would it be in the country?
Imagine you're the field marine.
You get the bullet and back.
You look for an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a fluid on the left side of your bombsight is warning you that a defense behind you is going to attack you, normally you wouldn't see it, but the Rio system is advanced.
You move to the protection area.
Another flash will warn you there's an open receiver.
You toss the balloon, but you deliver you.
And the bullet loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, yet the receptor sees in your bombsight a grass area that lights up and can modify the race.
It goes up, catch the balloon, running and antenna.
The public links and the fans have followed the play from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'll make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
The augmented reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just like bread and circuit, like our usual entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports lights.
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show you how harmful their actions are from the perspective of vitality?
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia.
How much is it worth for a Harlet commander or a Neil Defender Tieson trying to inspire a generation of children so that they think more about space and science instead of quarterly and Kartial notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions that we take and the challenges that we face and the challenges that we face, depend on us.
Thank you.
I was recently red after 23 years of service at the Great Catholic Patient of California.
Most of those 23 years I was walking in the southern end of Marine County, including the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known globally, by its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspired architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gates Bridge was open in 1963.
Joseph Streets, the chief engineer embedded to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically to suicide.
The suicide from the bridge is not practical or likely.
But from his openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension -- this bridge has been identified as such, such as the fall of it freed you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath clean your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a from four to five seconds, the body hit the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which they drill vital organs.
The majority dies in the impact.
The ones that don't, usually they stand in the helpless water, and then they get stuck.
I don't think that this method of suicide is realizing the death of the death that they face.
This is the cord.
Except about two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are at before they take away life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in your darkest moment, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young year was talking to an officer contemplating her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the bank.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We fought to channel the path through these calls.
This wasn't just a bad service to those who continue suicide, but the officers as well.
We've traveled a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new officers in the world.
This is Jason Garren.
I met him on July 22 last year by getting a call from a possible suicide subject sitting on the heart near the center.
I answered, and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Golden Gate bridge officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason and asked us if we knew the story of the Pandora's box.
By remembering the Greek mythology Zeah, Zeoran created Pandora, and he sent her to the Earth with a box, and he said, "No, never open that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
They came up with places, pennis, and all kinds of evil against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no hope."
He stopped a few moments, he leaned up on the right, and it left.
This lovely and smart guy from New Jersey just removed life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had asked it.
The collective damage of suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions, what would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved to be suicide?
What would you say?
Do you know what to say?
In my experience, not just to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't argue, button, or tell the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the point of inflection you need.
If you think that someone is suicide -- you don't have any fear of tackling them and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, "You know, others in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life -- have you had these thoughts?
Confused the person in front of it can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to look for despair, to believe that things are terrible and never going to improve -- impossible, believe that there is nothing you can do about it, recent social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it is with her permission and blessing that I read them.
"Hello, Kevin. I imagine you're at TED conference.
It must be the whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite amazing, but noticing more moments to really realize that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving Peter to San Francisco to see the part of the 49 with her father on January 19.
It never came there.
I called the police, and I repeated it as a disappeared night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house, and I was informed that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge at 1.5 in the evening of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with me for your struggle.
The GG: the Golden Gates Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, Victoria."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and get the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I responded to a radio call by a possible subject on the ground of the bridge near the north tower.
I drove my bike, and I looked at this man, Kevin Berkeley, standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, I immediately crossed the bank, and you stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and half a second, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day back on that lane and giving life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, he happiness.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made you go back and give you hope and life one opportunity?
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I listen.
I let me talk and just listen to it.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to read them.
"Dear Britain, nothing will erase the 11 of March 11, and you are one of the reasons why Kevin goes on with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was calling for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly medicated.
I adopted Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those heroing traits -- but thanks to God, now we know that.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
I certainly in debt with you, Narrator Berkeley."
And in the end, she wrote, "Pit -- when I visited the San Francisco General Hospital that night, you would figure out like the patient.
"I know I had to solve it."
Today, Kevin is an active father of society.
It speaks openly about the events that day and their depression with hope that their story inspired others.
Sustainability is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, I stole the opportunity to know it.
This is what the suicide.
For most of the suicide people, or those who consider suicide.
They just want their own pain.
Typically, this is only about three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've answered and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and climate calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason was.
The other one was a man who talked about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three times.
In the final press, he looked at me, and he said, "Men, sorry, but I have to go."
And I jumped out.
Horrible, absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people who we are going to contact in that bridge are not suicide.
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second thing that they leave the gang realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect Mario with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that each and every one of us should strive for doing.
Sustainability can be prevention.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you know what you're not going to, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question is this: How do you become that?
I must be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had achieved the dream that had had a child.
My outside outside was my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I'm going to refer to me later when I look at this picture I think -- you get Gerry, you get it, you get it.
But the past October, I discovered that, I am just beginning.
We all get rid of our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value to release it, to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin or for the beliefs of around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo that is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this fire is called revelation.
This is mine.
They recorded me as a child, as a child, because of the appearance of my genius.
I remember my five years in Los Philips, in my house, I always carried this t-shirt on your head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in your head?
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl.
I knew then how to get to it.
The gender has always considered an immune fact, but now we know that it's something more complex and mysterious, actually.
Because of my success, I never really dare to share my story, not because I thought it's going to be a bad thing, but how the world treat those of us who want to liberate them.
Every day I appreciate being women.
I have mom and Dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of the slimes.
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries to celebrate these mysteries in the Philippines.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was 15, I met this woman called TED.
It's the director of a transit beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the beauty concept?
He said to me that if she was involved with the expense of instructions and the version of the way -- and that night, he won the bathroom suit, won in gallon suit and was third end between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, it was within the world of the beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from a beauty of transfer women, but I can.
I also met the dinosaur goddess -- especially when we traveled to remote provinces of the Philips.
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that they took my request on the green card that I could go live the United States.
I was residentially.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty reader."
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you moved to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of gender?
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested me to put two and my name.
She also accompanied me when I operate in Thailand at the age of 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most prestigious and sophisticated surgery.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before we change the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, and the name of General Gene and Federal "Gene."
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a suit, but for me it was the license to live, to feel dignity.
Suddenly, my fears saw minimizes.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think about this woman from Man Networks.
A young woman from New York who was going to live his truth, but he was describing it to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our rates of suicide are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every single 20 of November, we make a global vagina by the Democratic Day of the Trenching.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who fought and stood on the installation.
These are Marshall P. Johnson and Sylvia River.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, expression, so that one day there are no more views of 20 of November anymore.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  KT: General, a quick question.
George Rock, of course. You see, first, thank you all my blessing.
To my support network, my parents, especially to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've attended young women trained, which I've ever started, and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it. I took the phone, called my mom and said, "Mommy, you can call this woman."
Sometimes it worked, others don't. It's just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us are assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that does not be a strange agriculture, and that there should be a space that allows people to advance, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transgender movement is starting compared to gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. GG: Thank you.
In many patriarchal and tribal societies, parents generally know about their children, but I'm one of the few fathers who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Male started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007, and when his efforts were homedwill, in the meeting of the Jewish National Prize of peace, he became very famous, a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at human history, the history of women is the history of injustice.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when you birth a child, your birth is not celebrated by it.
It's not welcome -- not for his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes from his condition to mother and no one happiness to the father.
And a mother was very overwhelmed for having a girl.
When I give birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, he completely completely, and with the hope of a son, when he gets her third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother is suffering, but the daughter. The daughter was born, when it grows, it goes as well.
At the age of five years, when he should go to school, he stays home and the school attached to his brother.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow it has a good life.
You can get fun.
It can play with his friends on the street, and it can move down the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into the teenager, when she was 13 years old, he was protected to go out of his house without a male accident.
He's confined at four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
He becomes the honor call of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you transcend the code of that honor, it would even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumptions of honor, not only affects the life of a girl, also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, sacrifice the joy of his life and the happiness of his sisters in behalf of the honor of honor.
And there's a normal rule of patriarchal societies called obesity.
A good girl has to be very quiet, very humble and very subtle.
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be called back.
It's supposed to be silent and it accepts the decisions of his father and his mother and the decisions of the elderly and even if it doesn't want.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like or if you marry it with an old man, it has to accept it, because it doesn't want to be a dependencies of disease.
If you take it very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, they will call it distribution.
And what happens at the end?
In words of a poetry, "The Cassin, the career, and then gives birth to more children and daughters."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, it includes the same life of obligation to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle goes on and on.
I loved brothers and sisters when I was born, and for the first time, believe me, I didn't like the newly born ones, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely honored.
And much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a legendary fight of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malamax from Maharaw, and he called my daughter like this.
But when I looked at me, all of these were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I brought a line from my name, and I wrote, "Max."
And when she grew up, when she was four, she was four and a half years old, I admitted it in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?"
Yes, I should mention it.
They can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for child life.
In a school that means the recognition of his identity and his name.
An administrator to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations, where they can explore their potential for their future.
I have five brothers, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised two weeks before, when I was feeling the Canadian view form, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason my daughter value.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and the satisfaction of my daughter.
I encouraged her when my friends came to me.
I encouraged it to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to instill them in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Malay.
I've been sharing all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for emission.
He taught my daughters, he taught students to forget the lesson of obesity.
He taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called Southern South.
We wanted brothers and sisters, we fought more rights for women, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and particularly for women's rights.
It was called the talking.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use candles and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silent, the slow girls and the singing singers killed.
They suffer millions, but a few talked about, and it was terrifying to have all those people who kill and retain when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
By the age of 10 years, Malay stood up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a diary for the BBC blog, he offered herself for the New York Times documents, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread as a class around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and on October nine of 2012, they shot him to burn in the head.
It was a satellite day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was discussing between life and death, he whispered her ear to my wife, "Should I blame me for what happened to my daughter, your daughter, to your daughter.
And he suddenly said, "Please don't blame you.
It defines the fair cause.
You put your life in play by the cause of truth, by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter is inspired by you, and you joined you.
They were both on the right path and God protected it."
These few words meant a lot for me, and I didn't ask again.
When Malay was in the hospital and he had severe pains, and strong headaches of head because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow spread through my wife's face.
But my daughter never complained to me.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my traffic smile and the experimentation in my face.
I'll get good. Please don't worry.
It was a comfort for us, and it was constantly consumed.
We wanted brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
He cried when he didn't end up his homework.
He fights his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special in my tutor that has done so audacious to bad so brave and expression and essentially?
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
Ask what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operating from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the brain science has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
I want to tell you that I recently joined the Monterey group of Google, where I've had a division to my burden -- the visualization of Google X, but all the work I'm going to talk about here today about brain science, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you join an operation of brain.
Are you still just as smart or not?
Don't you be like this, you can be intelligently?
After neuroscience, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and neuroscience.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what amount to make, more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mixes of chemicals, and try to get them to get alive.
More than one time I've been saved by a bit.
But luckily, I have an experimental soul, so I decided that I would experiment to try to get the optimal doses because there really doesn't exist a clear map that says it in delicious.
I started testing with different mixes and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in the doses changed dramatically my autonomo, my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly awesome case, for a few months, I tried to test doses and typical chemicals for a man in New York, and I was surprised by seeing how my thoughts were changed.
I was always furing, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe a few versions of them.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be an argument.
In fact, I was trying to figure out a problem that I had in front of it, and it just doesn't happen like that.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my dose.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go.
What I was trying to do, when I adjust those hormones and neuroscientists and so on, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the operation, my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think about almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want to try and try new ideas and remember situations.
These kinds of thoughts is not new.
Films like Hump, Describes and Hobbers look at things in a similar way.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are the people who question this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative thinking and investment.
So after several years, I managed to find the point right and I have a lot of great mental magnets, really vivid and well sophisticated and good.
Now, I'm working on how to take very quickly these mental images, my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what happens if a movie director was able to use your imagination only to steer the world that has the front?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to make this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image for functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by Give Gands and their Harvard colleagues.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The media column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while imagining that same image.
The column on the right was created by looking at the content of the central column of the left column -- you see that the difference is almost denial.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost nuclear.
Now, let me share you another experiment. This is from Jack Gallo lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into recognizing visual fields.
Put it this way.
In this experiment, they showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were scanned their brains to create a great range of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while a new scan was recorded.
The computer, using just the brain information of the scanning was defined to show what seemed the person to be seeing.
On the right, you can see the depressions of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us books.
We're right about to do it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same map.
This led to the brain scanning systems of greater resolution today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introduced electrodes to it.
I don't offer you for that.
Many of them are providing new projection techniques for images -- even me -- relying on the recent outcome of MRI, first we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the road?
conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets, but at this point, larger magnets only offer little improvement in the resolution, don't increase by thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets, let's make better magnets better.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort at the MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most recent advances in resolution of ingredient and brilliant solutions in coding and decrease, in the transmission and the frequency frequencies of FDA in the MRI systems.
In turn, instead of a uniform magnetic field, we use structured magnetic patterns attached to the Friending Ramp French.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the French radio frequency processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single scanned.
Also, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using MRI we should be able to measure not just the fluid of blood blood, but the hormones and neuroscience that I've mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity -- this is the dream.
We'll be able to fly our ideas in direct ways to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go on top of language and communicate directly through thinking.
What would we be able?
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be remarkable to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's cure and similar diseases.
We have a few more options to open up this door.
But anyway, pick a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that to take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about coming out of the closet, not in a traditional sense, not just the gay shadow.
I think we all have arms.
His closet may be to tell some person for the first time that the love or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that one has gone through in life.
All trade is a difficult conversation, and even though our subjects can really vary, the experience of having lived and have come out of that shame is a universal thing.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working at the South Side Walter Cafe, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensive military intensity -- not to track my armpits to quote the lyrics of Adam Dea France as a literature.
And I'm going to be sorry that by the Holocaust of my short pants and I had taken my head out of my head, I would say, "I would usually ask a small child, "Hey, are you guys or girl: Are you guys or girl: you're girl.
And this is a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I would push my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a rage of rain.
The father would immediately run the newspaper, and mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I would say nothing and boiling inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"Are you a guy or a boy?
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to enter the female issues on the table.  I had the dates of Betty France.
Gloria Steven quote.
Even a short sense of the Vagina Monologues" that I would show up.
So I would breathe around and go down and go down and get my hands a four-year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist degree, just a little girl with a question: "Are you guys or girl: "Are you guys or girl: "Are you guy or girl: Are you girl.
So I would breathe around again, and I stood on my neck and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confused.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I see a kid's clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like you to use a pink dress and sometimes like to use a comfortable palm.
Well, I'm more than the guy of a comfortable paper.
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite painting is violent and you have a fish.
Can you give me a parachute, please?
And that was it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the penguin that I asked for that?
It was the easiest conversation of everybody ever had.
Why? Because the paradigm of the park and I, both of us were honest one with the other.
Just as many of us, I've lived in some ships in my life, and yes, often my walls used to be an architects.
But in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You only know how one feels living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different than yours or your yours.
I will surely give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of your closet, but this is the thing: What's difficult is not relative.
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain someone who has been declared in rat bank is harder than saying it's been delight?
Who can tell me that this story that is more difficult to say to your five year-old child who will divide you?
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the difficult.
We need to stop classify what is difficult to do with what it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse relative to our arms and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in traders, and they may make sense of security, or at least safer than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, no matter what their walls are made, a shark is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine itself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, a dress and a high rubber shoes.
It was not the military lesbian prepared to fight any four-year-old child who would go into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, closed into a corner of my dark closet by making my big gay grain, and the moving of just a muscle is the most scary thing ever ever ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not disappoint them, and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that big, you'll kill you.
One of my most memorable grain launch was on my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my honor lab labs in my honor and steady lab, I walked around the tables and finally got to one where the friends of my parents, people who met me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women said, "I love Nathan Lander."
And the gay portrait battle had begun.
"Ah, would you ever be in the Castle?
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's fauntane.
"Ah, you know my static Atlanta."
It's very good and never talked about having a bonus."
"Ah, what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program, Will and Grace.
And you know who we love it? Jack in Jackson.
Jack is our favorite, favorite."
And then a woman, which was disconnected, but in hope of showing his support, to make me know that he was on my side, finally said basically, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the grains of grain.
Sure, it might have been easy to indicate where they felt lived.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were working on.
And what else can you ask someone, but to essentially?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you get.
That's how hard conversations are still still my strong point.
Ask anybody that I came out with.
But I'm getting better, and I know what I like to call the three principles of the Pacial Girl.
Now, please look at this through gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Hold the army. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be global, the others have to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be directors. Just give it -- you just tell it.
If you know they're gay, you tell it.
If you say to your parents that maybe you might be gay, they'll keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important.  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You never apologize for that.
And some of you can get safe wounds -- you know what they've done, but you never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel decode, but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark harmony by making a grain, you must know that we've all been there before.
And they might feel very lonely, but they're not.
Thank you, Bollywood. Enjoy the slide.
Intellectuality, what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote of Hispanic Dianos that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.
When Edit Didesis wrote this as a criticism to the personality pioneers like Alan Turkey.
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race, you know nothing about the biology of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but you have amazing telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can look at Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the intelligence of the Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain moment in time, the asteroids that demolish the surface of a planet really stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that I understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I analyzed a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that that they saw, I think, toward a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally adopted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing universal states that maximize diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and putting them together, I asked, for the past several years -- there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues?
Is there just an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to one and = for the intelligence I've seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices, with a T force, with the diversity of possible future accessibilities, yes, until an impending future time, touch.
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to get caught down.
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open choices.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How predictive is it?
It predicts the level of human intelligence?
Do you predict artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: recent research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disaster, or "regrette," for their life should have trend to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence is an deepest relationship to it?
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with long-term entropy production, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find it, we've developed a software engine called the Encouraging, designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system that is found inside.
Amazingly, interconnected could happen multiple animal intelligence testing, play human games, and even win money by eating actions, all of it without that they would have done that.
Here are some examples of interpretation in action.
Just like a foot human without fall, here we see introducer engaging automatically a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal to it.
He just decided for his account to balance the position.
This ability to balance will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technology.
This capacity of tools of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate with extreme opposite from a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that entropy can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
The entropy is widely applicable to a variety of domain.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of point against itself, illustrates its potential for play.
Here we see the entire negative organization of new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and keeps the network out of the network.
This same network of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see the Encouraging of the routes of a ship floating floor, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand global level its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see the super-existed intervention and execute a shopping strategy, which is a silent series of action negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under its research exponentially.
This risk of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex Wikipedia, what you've seen is that a variety of intelligent human behavior brands such as tool use, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony here.
Let's go back to the beginning of the robot of the robot, the work "Worker," there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines, there would be a cyber rebellion relief.
The machines would get up against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe every single decade, we've had the whole concept of cyber rebellion to investment.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then metabolism and try to get to the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly to take control, instead of being the reverse.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
I often ask me, "How is it that you look for goals to get away from this kind of mark?
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help you build artificial intelligence or to help them build human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquer of stars and losing the planet we call "downtown."
Now, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how Earth is in the context of the universe.
NASA Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which points out that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint light intensity when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the size of planets besides the distance of the distance between them and their mother star.
In contrast, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and recognitional like the Earth's planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their sun.
In turn, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this testament of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is celebrating under the weight of humanity.
2012 was the hottest record.
The male ice and ice ice that have been with us from a millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on the global scale have quickly overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, no attribute.
But I study the alliance of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I seek alien opportunities in the immoral sector.
Now, as someone very interested in pursuit of life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to the Earth, the more enjoy our own planet.
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better."
Let's take our neighbors, Mars.
Mars is small and reason and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, shown this by a mission like Kepler.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our Rover as the "Cubaton track its surface in pursuit of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit the orbit -- like the Maliest mission, they take samples of the atmosphere atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their Goldilocks and lose their rehabilitation.
private companies now offer not just a short space flight, but also the theory of living on Mars.
But even though all these Martian images remind us to the desert of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the cutting-edge ideas and people, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the desert areas of our planet that are still going to collapse, really alien places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and smaller places of the Earth, the air is fresh and oxygen reflective by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonies of Mars and other players are going to be a big and sad shadow -- the implications and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save us from this sub-Saharan substance of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable, the Earth.
And so I like the interplanetary exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to save humanity is like imagining that the Titanic captain will tell us that the face of truth will be in the wild.   Thank you.
But the goals for interplanetary exploration and land preservation are not contained.
No, they are actually faces of the same coin, the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world lights as extraterrestrial pants.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile and unstable areas of the Earth, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment, the Fermine paradox.
Many years ago, the American Fibro physicist said, considering that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life to now.
Well, where are you?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermine paradox is that when civilizations become technologically advanced enough to continue to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of what's important to protect the origin of planets that drive this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the interplanetary colony will save us of ourselves, but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to support the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the Goldilocks on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pocket, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where I left them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all closed down.
I thought about calling a creature, at least I had my cell phone, but in the midnight, a closing could take a long time to come in, and I was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the morning next morning, and I was aware of my passport.
It would be expensive, but I sure not more expensive than a ceremony in the middle of the middle -- so I thought, in spite of circumstances, I went out right now.
I'm a professor of profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
Contrast that increases heart rhythm, modular levels and sheet of thinking.
And when I got to the lunch counter in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in their place, that they avoid bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen, that they minimize the probability of being a total catastrophe to it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't create.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Kamer, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called prosperity retrospective.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Kenya, who had written from this a few years before, known as the pregnant.
Everybody knows what the posture is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the promise, as Danielle, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, next, try to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk to you about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a pregnant.
Some of them are evidence, others are not so obvious.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it will lead a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis -- based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hypothesis, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of important things, which is the good, where the fish are, which located the fruit trees, where the friends live and the enemy.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes through the London takes.
It's the part of the brain that allows the shadows to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody actually did the experiment, they cut the smell of the short streets, and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys of the car, reading and passport glasses.
So at home they have a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For his passport, a particular box.
For their reading glasses, a particular message.
If you take a place and you are surprisingly, it will always be there when you look at them.
What about travel travels?
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards, literature of driving, passion, send them for email to themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or steal them, this can facilitate the substance.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortex.
The cortex is toxic and entire thinking.
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress, we're not going to be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is written as a profession to all make medical decisions, and in fact for financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decisions that you have to make that benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little higher."
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases attack, heart attacks, breakthrough brain.
So you are thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best thing, then the doctor says, "I'd like to pick up a drug that will help you reduce the color, a station.
And maybe you've heard about the statistics, and you know that it's one of the most recent drugs in the world today. It's probably likely to know people who take them.
So you think, "Yeah, recognize the station."
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistics that should be asked to ask for most physicians don't want to talk about, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the U.N., the number needs to treat.
And what is this NASA?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or join a surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And should you think about what kind of decentralized statistics is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not get me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a collection of the doctor, and if it's a blame of someone, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood underlying mechanisms very well.
But the Galvani estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely recycled statue, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300 percent.
This according to the research of cynical researchers Jeff Group and Pamela Harar, confirmed independently by Biology.
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take medicine for a year before you avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another adverse event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 of me will go down my colleague.
Why not? Doctor, I give me the recipe anyway.
But then you have to ask for a more statistics, and it is, "Hey of the High School, right?
For this particular medicine, side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things, bananasorian muscle pain and artificial pain, but now they think, "From five percent isn't very likely to happen to me, still take the medicine."
But a moment.
Remember that under stress, they don't think clearly.
So think about how you would use this over time, so you don't have to manufacture the rate of reasoning in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped it, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out by the drug that you help your medicine.
I don't say that they should or not take the stigma.
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic requires it, it's part of the informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number need to be a pretty typical one.
For the surgery that the older men are done in 50, extended from prostate prostate -- the number need to treat is 49.
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for a person who's helped to.
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include the impossibility or the erectile dysfunction or a free incentive income, relative engineering, fecal innovation.
And if you have lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects will only take a year or two.
So the idea of the pregnancy is to think about before time the questions that you can pretend to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change your opinion in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems come off.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator -- it's not necessary the digestive system, or the limit or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react to fast. They could be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is rational logical thinking, like Danny Kansando and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to train ourselves to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all defense.
We're all going to fail at the time.
The idea is to think about the future how those fails, to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize damage, or to prevent bad things happen in the first place.
Rediscovered on the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contract installed me a combination of combination alongside the door, with a death from the door in the same one, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of emails that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized. But I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Pinnel, "I is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing smoke.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a piece of parachute, you need to play more small.
Two pains, even smaller.
Four price, extremely smooth started.
This is my drawing of a piece of piano -- that is that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of piece of pilot can never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence, a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the Asia, besides a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came during the 1800, and over time, it mixed with local signs, and the language that we know today like Asia.
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for anything.
Sound are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person living in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, organisms, behaviors and rules without asking them.
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my hands and amplify sound.
I learned and copied that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people respond to it.
So I've learned for example.
"Don't really pile the door."
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of free chips.
"Don't eradicate, and when you're eating, make sure you're not going to feed the covers in the plate."
I call this sound "award" state.
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm a survey of the sounds of sound.
And I'm always waiting with the sound of sound, which is to come next.
From there, this drawing.
Trials, to decide.
BG: There is BBCOD.
The TBP: for announced.
You can see that the picture doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because lines already contain sounds through subtle and slices together.
In the deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for Philadelphia in AOL.
A typical picture has five lines.
However, to me, to do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawing I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resident there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
During this summer, I visited museums and different galleries of different galleries and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has entered my art territory now.
Is it going to give me more than art?
And I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a total way, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and figure it out.
I started to create a new job body.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was advantage, it was a little bit of an listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could just get to me and my artistic work, or I could be empowered.
I chose that I would be experienced.
There's a massive culture around the language that is talked about.
And just because I don't use my literary voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like equal and become my voice.
And so I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with many different interpretations of AOL.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking their voices, I am able to maintain a temporary way of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I wasn't going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could slow down in the forgotten and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, deep in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and AOL.
For example, a musical note can't be captured and expressing purely on paper.
And the same thing can say from a concept in AOL.
The two are very spatial and highly modular that means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much as the sounds of sounds.
I'd like to share a metaphor of the piano, so that they understand better how AOL works.
So, imagine a piano.
ATA is divided in many different grammar parameters.
If you assign a different parameters for every finger while you touch the piano, as the facial expression of the body, the speed, the speed, the shape of your hand and so on, as you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you would just put it up at a time.
However, the Asia is more like a chord -- you need 10 fingers in a simultaneous way to express a clear concept or an idea in AOL.
If only a keyboard would change the chord and create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in tone and hunger and volume.
In AOLHA, using these different graphic parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the story is the story of that."
This is the story at that."
I'm looking at you.
So looking at it.
Oh, I was shocked.
Utan Oh.
What are you looking at?
Oh, basically."
So I started thinking, and if I see Ashana through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could be a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of day," the sun comes out and it gets over.
This is all day."
If I repeat it and reduce the speed, virtually it looks like a musical piece.
All the day.
I feel like the same thing can say from all night.
"All the night.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of nights, "No, during the night   "The night."
I feel like the third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time you express the time in AOLC, and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one hero is a hand, two heroes -- it's two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a long time ago.
Then happened, I used to the last one, and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, had one time."
Common time, it's a musical term with a specific rate of four times for companies.
However, when I see the word "the word "the "money, I think automatically in the same time."
Look at MD: right hand -- E, left hand.
We have the picture through the head and the chest.
(Music: MT: M. Come from flush "Come -- "My Common Come -- "Middle, fall -- "Is I going to show you a shape of your hand called "award" "fate" "for "award."
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like the chest, something like a common time."
Yes, very good.
That means "engineering."
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means "colonization in AOL.
Now, the third one. Please add me again.
And again.
It's literature in AOL.
Let's do the three together.
"Foundation," collapsed, and literacy."
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest, but they transmit very different meaning.
It's amazing to see how Asia is alive and present, like music.
However, today, we live in a very automatic world.
And just because the Asia doesn't have sound, automatically no social value.
We have to start questioning what it defines social value and allowing ASCA to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn AOLC: Not that you have to hear to learn music.
ATA is a rich treasure. I would like you to have the same experience.
I would like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can get rid of us.
Thank you.
Dean Kartuati, Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can test everything, but then you have to clean it up.
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or an ignorance bubble must say, because adults lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
As I get older, I learned that adults also respond and that they're not very good at cleaning the other ones.
The time happened, now I'm an adult and teaching citizen at Harvard Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we clean the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a sexy thing.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we classify them, and we collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boat.
So together with my students, at age six to 15 years, we dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong, in a workshop.
We started building this technique of work with advertise so that the very low children can also participate.
And I'll tell you, children who manipulate electrical tools are very cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragmentation.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine them into something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces, we just collect information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this plastic, children are excited a lot with robots.
Then we quickly created what we call a prototype."
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we end before lunch.
And we transform light and camera cameras and put it into a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and by the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer to protect this image and measure the size of each particle to get an approximate estimate from the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this invention step-by-step on a website for inventors called "Stephenics, with the hope that somebody else is even better.
The great thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and boom, they're trying to fix it immediately.
"I can investigate my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, you get the Internet, and you stumbled with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill -- just using the hands in Southernmous, the largest mangrove forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you drink, it's the water that you barely, the water where you fish, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and mud and oil are also brown color and when everything gets mixed up, it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called speed, which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a spectrum that can get through all kinds of substances that produce different species, which can help identify what is in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and sent it to Bangladesh.
What's great about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
"I can investigate a problem for distribution? I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe I will address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese half a French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they have a number of giant waves, called tubes, and those tsunami transferred several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fucker, a nuclear center near water.
And today, according to reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has progressions for Besensers.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure Fucker radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it looks safe enough, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to Fucker every year from accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, we didn't take them, the parents didn't let them.
But every night we report the control center, you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously but they did that, because they are going to have to live with the radiation all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data that we picked up that day and we talked about what we were going to do after, the strategies, the international, etc.
And to do this, we created a rudimentary map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of electricity, we introduced pigment to represent data in real time of radiation, and we rock water to simulate rain.
With this, we could notice that the radioactive dust was filtered from the top of the mountain to the river system and described in the ocean.
It was an approved estimate.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear centers to date.
We went up to 1.5 miles away from nuclear center, and with the aid of the area of the area we were collecting seasons of the sea milk with a self-destructive series that we invented and built.
Here's a progression, we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been more frustrating because we've only been beginning to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong, and we turned it into the largest space of social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, chemistry, a little biology, of optical -- you can basically build almost all of the way there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
Students, acceleration." Acceleration."
Center Harvard, we asked questions like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the advanced population by transforming their own standard wheelchair in new electrical vehicles.
plastic, oil and activity are terrible legal, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect children in the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So, scientific citizens -- creative, sleep, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin companies, two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the single silk story.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
A matter of environment, the other one creates it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for her.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the marble memory, he saw a figure that struggles for being free.
The clip was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not celled up.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we take all the information required by every cell to work and to replicate it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by rules of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, including the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as amazing parts of different functions.
But you don't find heart material assembly in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with dialogue pores.
The skin pixels are more thick.
You act primarily as a filter, the other mainly beautifully barrier, and yet, it's the same skin, there are no parts, no amounts.
It's a system that will gradually vary its functionality through variation variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architect to work right now between the clinic and the gene, between machine and organism, between amount and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at its simplest level, is trying to bring these two visions out of the world, moving away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't this possible 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they build four disciplines that offer access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through scale, of large-scale scanners, like this robotic arm with a 24 feet of diameter with a value of value that some day not very far print out of entire buildings, and graphics to nanoscale made of genetically engineered microbes that shine in the dark.
So here we've reinvented the phone, an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is unique to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion in Paris with Erik van Herbievallan. It's like a second skin made from one piece, recorded in the contexts, flexible around the belt.
Together with 3D printing collaborator 3D, we printed this layer and false 3D skirt between the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combined rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 microwave resolution.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a C.
That designers have access to this high resolution and synthetic instruments, allowing you to design products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues, too.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, comfortable and also that it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator -- we went back to nature to inspire us, and by designing this irregular surface, it becomes a sustainable.
We print this 44 different property surface, which vary in rich, optimism and color, correspond to pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like nature, vary its functionality not through the addition of another material or another assembly but variable continually and deliberately materialistic property.
But is it the ideal nature?
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Hebrew Bible, and one of them left me and came to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she stores, "In the third day of creation, God sent the Earth to grow a brutal tree carried of fruit."
For that first fundamental tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches and leaves and fruit, frustrated.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made the ground grow trees with branches and cortex, streets and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects were made from one piece.
Are we going to go back to a better state of creation.
So we looked for the biblical material -- the kind of material of the fruit tree with fruit, and we find it.
The second most abundant biosphere on the planet is called quantum, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs and suggestions and butterflies and butterfly.
We think that if we can tune their properties, we could generate multinational structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal marijuana.  We asked a lot of screens of shrimp -- the molecules and we produced the horse pass.
Variation the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
To print out the large-scale structures -- it was built a system with multiple controlled extraction buttons.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material -- three meters long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural shape to the contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic.
The air bubbles that were an incompase of the printing process were used to contain physical microbes that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we embedded the bacteria genetically designed to capture quickly carbon in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of versage to mesh and if you expand more even more, to windows.
A brutal tree loaded from fruit.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp scans in an architecture that is behaving like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed for biological, you put in the sea, feed the marine life, and put on the ground, help grow a tree.
The driver for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain the life for interpretational travel.
To do that, we need to dominate bacteria and control their flow.
So as the periodic table, we did our own table of elements -- new life forms of life completely created completely manufactured and increased by biological form.
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid alpha -- only instead of making beautiful metals -- they synthesize new biological functionality within very small channels.
This field is called microbial.
We print our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they combined two microbes.
The first is the circuit.
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second one, E. collaborate, the bacteria that live in the human intestine.
One makes light in sugar, the other sugar consumption and produces useful biofuels.
But these two microbes don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think of it as a evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help that they flow these bacteria and they alter their way on the road.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, saving the properties of the material according to desired function.
If we wanted more pictures, we designed more transparent channels.
This profitable digestive system, when it would stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our thin intestine.
And here it is, as a TED primates, our first profitable physics, chemical linked channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shell said, "We are creating modern creatures, only half is done."
What if design would provide the other half.
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, they would repair the damaged tissue and they would have our bodies better?
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
It grows up. It has sophisticate.
This worm of worm, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which is medicated.
The non-violent manufacturing is about this level of sophistication.
It makes it through combination not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations of it.
An act as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, using those fibers with each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is being put in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then starts to sink a box of compression.
The tension and engagement, the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we put a small magnet into the head of a silk worm to the hill.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat plate, not within a box, we realized that it would sink a flat box and still metropolitan since.
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolding -- and we've discovered that the way, the composition -- the structure of the film, is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often hold the silk worms to death inside their cocoons. Their silk gets rid and uses in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these plants we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single knife.
They were meditated, and we could create these things.
So let's climb this process to architectural scale.
We had a liquid robot making silk plans, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms to more dark and cold areas -- so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or airplanes, to block the rays of light and heat down, distribute the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the organizations.
We asked for 650 silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after food four weeks, they were prepared to sink with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the scaffolding and as they did, they created, they were standing up, they put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
As a giant biological silk on the richer silk robots, they give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, six sea worms stop 5,000 miles.
In a symmetry contrast, this is also the length of silk route.
The police, after the economy, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional papers in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk silk through a robotic arm, the other film filled with.
If the last frontier of design is to give products to products and buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers have to unite these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new age of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from an inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we make nature charge.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be from greater:
If you had to remember what age they had when they were asked for the first time?
You can show it with the fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be from greater:
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from greater:
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had too much.
In school I liked English, the kill and the art and the art and developed website, and I was playing the guitar in a punk band called Teleon Francisco.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I generally like to try and persist and persist anyway.
But over time, this feeling of boring, this feeling of this is no longer a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I am interested in another thing, which is completely different, and I dive on it, and I let it absorb and I feel like, "Yes." I've found the moment, and then again this point where I start to get bored.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to focus on that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure how it was going to become a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and refuse to get bored.
Another reason that I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong about this, and something wrong with me for not to define me.
I was worried about having a fear of engagement, or being dispersed, or to be disabled, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it, they learned it from the culture.
We first ask ourselves, "What do you want to be from more."
We are about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you answer to that age.
It's considered a naive question to provide nice answers in children like, "Be astronaut, or "Can I be picky: or "I want to be pink."
They will insert Hall discovered here.
This question is being done over and over again as we grow up in various ways, per per high school students are asked to be picked up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be from more."
It goes from being the cute exercise of before to the dream of the dream.
Why?
While this question inspired children to dream about what they might be, it doesn't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, just the opposite does, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults well tried to go and say, "Oh, what a cute, but you can't be artificial of rape and psychology.
You have to choose."
This is Dr. Bob Childs  and he is a volcanic and psychological artist.
And this Amy New, this magazine made in illustration, business and teacher and creative director.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choice.
But it is more than that.
The notion of central life is very identify in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real vaccine, the idea that each one of us has something to have to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who's not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up your curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a molecular.
A crowd is somebody with lots of interests and creative activities.
It's a mountain to say.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple and potential and day.
You can also use other terms that connect the same idea, as a school, renewable.
During the time of Renaissance, the ideal was who was well seen in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Sherge refers to us as schools."
They use any term they like or invent one of them.
It seems like a kind of adaptive to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see morality as a limitation or a application that you should be able to say.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
Here are three multinational superstitions.
One: ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
She said Hong Bonica and Rachel Bing expressed their shared interests in charge, data visualization travel, travel, mathematics and design, by founding Meldins.
Meldin is a company that creates interpreted geographies.
And Shah and Rachel came up with this unique idea of his ecological mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
There are new ideas.
And multiple people, with all their intentions, can access a lot of these international points.
The second multinational superpower is fast learning.
When the crowds are interested in something, we go to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're bound to be printing, because we have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort zones.
A lot of skills are transparent to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we see, so we rarely start in zero.
Norway Dunn is a full-time trip and independent writing.
As a pianist performing an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she is the fastest mechanics.
Before becoming writer, Norway was financial planning.
He had to learn the most final sales mechanics when he started their practices, and this skill helps him write talks for the editors for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to dedicate to what one draws you, even if the end is leaving it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have anticipated.
The third multinational superpower is adaptability. It is to say, the ability to transform in anything you need in a given situation.
Open Carth is sometimes director of videos, other pages designer, websites at times collection of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently, James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles -- depending on the needs of his clients.
Fast Company magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and predicting that are the individuals and organizations that can divide to satisfy market needs, which really will thrive.
ideas of ideas, quickly learning and adaptability -- three skills where the crowds are very adept -- and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster the crowds to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multiple mostly right now, and we need no conventional creative thinkers to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They came out of the bridge knowing because they wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeon.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come from a specialists and a spinning crowd.
The specialists can dive in depth and put in the practice of ideas, and the crowd offers an amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that harmony with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, the multiple multiple people are being trained to just be more like their specialized partners.
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: recognizing with the internal wiring -- whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist, then especially for all media.
That's where you will give the best of you.
But for multiple people in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, recognition with your many passion.
They follow their curiosity for those rabbit stores.
They explore the intersections.
embracing our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, multiple, the world needs.
Thank you.
In 1942, a woman named August was taken to a psychiatric in France.
Audience delivered and couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alanks.
Alaniscarcases did not know how to help August, but he was flying for her until unfortunately, passed out in 2006.
After his death, Alaniscar did a catalyst and they found strange plates and soils in the brain of August, of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more surprising.
If I have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than Alanian gave him 141 years ago.
Alasks was Dr. Antarctical Alaska.
And August Detail, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1941, medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections, a lot of treatments for cancer, antibiotics for HIV, statistics for carbon and much more.
But it's very much progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's cure for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affecting 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If you wait to live until age 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's to be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their years from Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's.
In the United States, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease, and its costs are paying a five times increase in 2050, as it aging the generation of the bomb bomb.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the top 10 death causes around the world, Alzheimer's only is the only one that can't prevent it, cure or even relate their development.
We understand the Alzheimer's less than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the research of cancer that in Alzheimer's research despite the fact that it costs us more about Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, but everybody has -- the Alzheimer's disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, everybody, even scientists, confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be sense in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with a patient of Alzheimer's patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to depending on a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's. I found strange plates and weird smiles in the brain of August a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that is folding as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are pressure.
And when you fold it, these sticky dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots stay on the outside.
This makes protein molecules stand each other, forming groups that can form big plates and smiles.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's brain.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like depending on a bomb.
To cut a cable could do anything.
Computer others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocked it, and then create a drug that does.
Until recently, most of them have reduced wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, genetics, chemistry, engineers, engineers and math.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they're moving with normal.
These worms on the other hand, they have protein molecules that are falling into each other inside them, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's a disease we can understand and cure.
After 141 years of hope, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow up that hope, to sell Alzheimer's self, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to realize that Alzheimer's a disease, and that if we try it, we can see it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have made more research and exercise about governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislation.
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to see cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too desperate to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain is running the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like August, who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They help speak for them, and help make a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article at the New York Times column in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers get together to get 36 more and more personal questions and then they look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number two: If you could wake up morning with a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number 28, when it was the last time you cry to another person?
And just alone?
As you move forward, these are more and more personal.
Number 30 -- this really likes me -- to tell your partner what you would say or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled with this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention, the joke that two of the participants had spent six months later and invited all of the lab to ceremony.
So it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but of course I was also intrigued too.
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to love it.
Nevertheless, we fell down, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to column love Colorado a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already an August already, so I guess some of you probably wonder, are they still together?
And the reason I think you care about this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published, it was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had used to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to some hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just from my friends of Facebook and imagine that my article in the New York Times would probably reach thousands of view.
And that took a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he said, I had no idea.
The paper was published online at night, and already the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've been called the Tower Show and the God Mora America.
In a month, the article received over eight million visits, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing with a sense of simple experiences, but another thing is to discover that the love life in one has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or write, what they did every day for weeks -- they always asked the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase, "Are you still still together?
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
They interviewed me on the radio and asked it.
I even gave a talk, and a woman raised up to the stage, "Hey, where's your novel)
And I immediately put it red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the representation of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have stolen life.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary article for San Valley, who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very nicely reserved with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we were both making a public emergence together.
I read television interviews, and results from the photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the innovative icon of the training process, a range for which I didn't feel the absolute qualified thing.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know whether it really worked, or whether it was able to produce a lost love, not just an adventure, but real love, a lost love.
But this was a question I wasn't able to answer me.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt, especially that people were asking the wrong question.
How do you know if we go together or not, and then say that?
If the answer was not, would you do the experience of asking these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in the same study in 1997, and there, the research goal was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for an international approach between college students, using what Aron called the Sweden personal openness, programmer and recovery.
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer after doing it, several previous studies also used the Free Protocell Protocol protocol as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of police and community, and they've used it between people of opposite political ideology.
The original version of history, which I tested last summer, that combined personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and said to me with the tendency, I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed puzzling.
And I said, "You want to say that you fall in love with the person who did it?
Well, he made a pause there.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, "But became better friends?
Did you feel that you got to know better after proving the studio.
He was a signal.
So, it worked. I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was virtually all my adult life, and he was my first real love -- and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I flew in science.
I figured out everything I could find about romantic love science, and I expected that to be able to break the heart.
And I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I just researched for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought that if I was bored with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and just like I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I look for.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than you can reasonably tell me.
What I find out of love is a guarantee -- not just to be loved today and being loved tomorrow, but to continue to be loved by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that media told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to fall in.
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the implicit risk, and this is a very attractive story, because love makes us feel wonderful, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the history that you say, "Are you still following together?
And your content with an answer of yes or not.
So more than a question, I would propose that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things complicated, and how do you know when to cut and distract?
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship, or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your partner?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, this is this: a year ago, a well-known study and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we love, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But love is not the same thing to remain love.
Love is the easy part.
So at the end of my article I wrote, love didn't happen.
We start in love because we take the choice to be.
And I set up a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had not considered all that choice.
I don't think about how many times we would make that decision, and how many times I have to continue to do that choice without knowing whether I will always pick me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answered 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous and kind, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't really think about.
And what I look for, and what maybe I'm going to spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the ultimate happy end on the title of my article.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he will also love me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little bit of legislation in full mountain and in a way, and I came up with a forest of the forest.
 something that really affected me but more details ahead.
I'll start with eight years old.
I took a wooden box and I buried a dollar bill and a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat the speakers.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has funny because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a given moment I was in Hawaii -- like to go from surgery and make surfing and all those weird things -- and I was doing a chicken for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I threw all the pages and I made a kind of the self-destructive blood to the Alger Martin, and I covered them in resin, and a bee was caught off.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's allergic to them, so I added more residential in the canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite happened: somehow it seemed like I increased the size of size, like you would look at the text with a magnifying magnifying text.
So I made more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs -- weird bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow the trick, drawing just like a chain in the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
First of all, buttons."
Then I made some strange insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the roof caps.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to Silicon.
It was great, man.
At some point I'm interested in human form, natural size sculptures with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I died.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the resin, and so on.
So I did this for years, and my work fought with something very big, that I call "doctoration."
For the "Rocketten," I was inspired by a great measure in "The Garden of Diagnosis Boston who is a painting at the Museum of the Project in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the "Rocketten: I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five meters long.
It's got twice as much as 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and the logging.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the representation world, to this analog mesh inferior where they hide.
This is where creatures with the heads of animals are heading into the water, ready to suicide the ocean in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a corner.
Billy Graham is in the sea, the Horrible -- the horizontal platform of the dead -- Waltal, the Rush Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can find if they look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of a woman.
He's coming out of the ocean, and he spit oil in a hand while the other hand comes up with clouds.
Their hands are like balances, and it seems like a microbial being that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the "rationality."
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand I wrote in.
And then when you go on the other side, you have a tropical, like a bird shark, and I spit clouds from this tribe.
It also has a tail of 500 feet long -- a stranger tail that joins the "of the "ordinary."
Anyway, his tail is going to fire when you put it on a volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a crowd ocean of criteria made from terrorist cards in 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were board cards from terrorists.
Very ahead to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, one is called psychologists.
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are encyclopedia, dictionary or magazine.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're as cells, they go together, they divide down.
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope obstacle that weighs 1,000 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the head -- it's the chest, you can interview the entrance here.
I'll give you the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or not, or whatever it has, a kind of anti-political thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't explain them for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body party in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the tropical city.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called Persian Words.
Within this box there's a physicist, a neuroscience, a particular, a music, a writer, a market, a school, a school, an editorial arm that drives all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
And we measure the box and all the people on the inside with each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you refuse who is and the box you're living in.
And together we realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with delight and genetically we're going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you give them your head?
Take an aspiration.
But so that this pill has an effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, the intestine and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and interpretation system so that any drug will be effective in the body.
The dependence, though, is that when you bring it out any drug is solved.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take antiretroviral drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the collection of CO2 cells.
But they're also known for their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time they take to get to the blood stream, they sell, and worse even over time they are going to get to their fate, which is where it's more important, in the HIV department.
These are bodies of the body like the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is intact, and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are based on regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the introduction of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with current drugs that are a treatment of life with oral origin.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Could we get the treatment directly to the virus tank, without the risk of diagraments of drugs?
As a scientific expert in lasers -- the answer was in front of me, the laser, of course.
If you use in dentistry, for the care of wounds and surgery of diabetes, you can use for anything to imagine, including the intelligence of the drug interspection.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or punch extremely small holes, which open up and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask yourself, "How is that possible?
We send a little bit of a little laser ray on the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in terms of microbes.
Before you even notice, the hole is reported immediately.
We're now testing this technology in vitro or in Petri plates, but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that possible? You can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a destruction of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make an investment at the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an inject that distributes the drug, releases it directly in the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV researchers, in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied the non-consumed groups of statistics, armed organizations like terrorists, insurgent or military terrorists.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting out.
My goal is to better understand these generous agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to nonviolent confrontation, not violent.
I do field work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a distance between states.
No.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-violent actors.
For example, from 21st peace entrepreneurs signed between 1975 and 2011, 1965 were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups, we even have to engage them or defeat them in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know the reasons why they fight, how they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and politicians are not related.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less demonstrating them, without a global view.
Today's armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, the Library of Liberia, known for their violent dress against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, Beijing has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamsalts, known by their suicide attacks against Israel, also administrator the France of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting off.
They're multiple molecules.
They set up a complex mammaling machinery, radio stations, TV channels -- websites of Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here's the magazine of ISAR, printed in English and published to recruit it.
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising of funding funding, but through profitable businesses -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Arms are also doing something else: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they manage hospitals, they put on a professional or microbial training program.
Hech provides all these services and more.
Arms are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not bringing, security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by war or even the beginning of the assembly of IRAS can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an impossible price for population.
But generally, providing social services means filling a cow, a gap left by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at armed groups, we just think about violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term view.
These groups are hydrogen.
They grow because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, they participate in violent struggle and get governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated these organizations, the less we can compute them as contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like Healthy?
They dominate part of a territory, they manage all their functions -- they pick up the trash, they manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is Israeli?
The lines are drawn.
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and hybrid nations, and the more weak the states, as in the Middle East, the more they intervene and fill that gap.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups to have to invest more in not military tools.
To fill that gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and cost peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we will better understand what incentives to offer to foster the transition of violence to no violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- not the military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a female.
My opinions about gender equality are small, but I fear that accepting open the female tag would be unfair for feminists.
I'm a female, but pretty bad.
And therefore I am abused as a bad feminist as well.
Or, at least I wrote an article and a book called "The Bad Feminist, and then in interviews, people started calling me the Baby Female.
So what started as a personal joke to myself and a deliberate transformation, has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the feminist -- these furry women, angry with men and they hate sex. As if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people when I was going to pretend that it could be feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was an accusation.
I was labeled as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which makes too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that reflective woman, until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are irreducing them -- women are equal to men.
We deserve the same ground by the same job.
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free or violence.
We have right to use easily and accessible the contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for legitimate control or evangelical doctors.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other identity.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality and social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have in account these differences and how they affect us, the same way that it matters in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evidence, but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist of me.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear music rap flag to all volume.
Although the letter degraded to women and offered me deeply, the classic "Salamand Shakespeare of the Young Hans Turing is amazing.
"Make it reality with your lawyer landscape.
Perfect, give you, move until you give you the concrete."
Think about it.
Pure poetry, right?
I'm completely driven by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  -- all the domestic tasks -- but also killing insects, the garbage collection, the care of grass and the maintenance of machinery.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
Enjoy the fashion magazines and the beautiful things.
I can see "The Backy and the romantic comedians, and I have an absurd fantasies of the stories that are actually made.
Some of my crimes are more decoded.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge it.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is confused so that women are economically vulnerable when they choose to choose women.
Let's solve this problem.
I reject the conventional feminist that has ignored or destroyed the needs of the color women, and workers and gay and transgendered women, to white women, straight, middle class and high.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist.
It's also the following: As a feminist -- I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put females in a pediatrician.
We hope that they give the perfection to the perfect person.
When we get decode, we would break them together with a lot of taste from the same dog where we put them.
As I said, I am a disaster, I am already thinking about that paper before you try to put it there.
Too many women, particularly the innovators and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be labeled as feminists.
They're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm feminist, for fear of what that label means, for fear of the fear of being able to be able to meet with little realistic expectations.
Take Benjamin or like I call it, the God.
In the last few years, it's a decline decouset.
In the August Museum of Audiences in 2014, at MIT, I act in front of the word "femator, three meters high.
It was a magnificent show, looking at this pop star about openly embracing feminism and making women know the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
In fact, the cultural critics started in the cultural debate whether Ben was or not exactly feminist.
They calculated their feminism instead of just believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We demand perfection of females, because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so carefully a lot.
We go far beyond the sensible and constructive criticism to give up the feminism of any woman, to pass it up until nothing is left.
We don't need to do that.
The evil feminist, or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point of party.
But what happens next?
We go from recognizing our improvements to give stories, to move to action and to be a little bit more valuable.
If I hear a degraded music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing an unlimited supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we raise change effectively to their gain.
Certainly it's hard.
Why does her music be so pleasant?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions are justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about my nieces and three and four years.
These are two magnificent girls, decided and brilliant girls, and also very brave -- I want you to grow up in a world.
Where you are excited for the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice was released as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sport, the Treese of Trees.
We can change radio emissions when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as a decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their partners as bottle of bottle.
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish your magazine in your project, or work with you, until you don't include a number of women, so much to participate to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication or your organization is more inclusive with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are unemployed but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also refuse to be included.
Because we are not a number of people, without taking these positions.
We can make these little acts of value and hope that our decisions get to the top, to the people in the directors, and the music producers and the music, CEOs, legislators, people who can make big decisions -- more courageous, to create a lasting and meaningful change.
We can also argue with our female value, well, bad, or any delight.
The last line of my book "Massachuc Feminist, says, "I would prefer to be a bad feminist to not be at all.
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say that, especially because I got my voice stolen and the feminist helped me to remember it.
There was an incident.
I call it incidental to do what happened.
A few girls folded me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I stole my voice, and after everything I don't believe I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And so I went back to writing.
I remember in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the skin sky.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminist, I also discovered that if it was a little courageous -- another woman could hear me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I support the humiliating reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit valuable, when you need more than that value.
Right after Christmas last year, 133 children in California had a measles for having visited Disney or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infected over 100 children in Color.
One of the tragic things in this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the Denmark outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly even worse, the autism.
But a moment, was it not the article that was unleashed about autism and decorated vaccines, decorated and killed by being a fraud that was deliberate by the British Medical Journal.
Doesn't most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a statistics?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatrician who had heard about her creating all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed just three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to shoot.
Foundation organizations like autism Spanish are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could get a little boy in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers of Disease Disease Center what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like "mission diagnostics, and a better chance of cases to explain these growing figures.
But that kind of language doesn't make a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks on the face of his two years, the visual contact of his son.
If the diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s.
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than to do with slow and powerful progress of science than with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be false and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist, Leo Kansa, from Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1934, Kansa published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be able to have private worlds -- none of the people around them, even to their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking hands in front of their faces, but they were pressure of the panic of men as when they didn't get their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, Kansa speculated that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, declared that he had seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome as it collects references from as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprising, because the Kansas of the dance for the diagnosis of autism were very restrictive.
For example, I decided to give that diagnosis to children with conversations, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was said he had become nine from every 10 children sent by other doctors to his consultant to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kaniel was a smart man, but part of his theories were not ceremony.
He classified autism as a form of child physicists caused by cold and deceased parents.
These kids, he said, have been held carefully in a refrigerator.
At the same time, though, Kanis noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that are agreed on certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphony before I was two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, "Beethoven been saying?
But Kaniel had a bad opinion of these skills, by adding things like children were just getting what they had heard their parents with peak, desperate by winning their approval to their persons.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers began to test Kanaki theory that autism was weird.
Long Winking, the cognitive psychologist of London, thought that the theory of mothers coming from Kansa was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and affectionate, and they had a profound autistic daughter called Susie.
Londo and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Susan without service services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Lord and his colleague, Judy Golden decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
They conducted a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
They asked a suburb from London called Cambridge to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the Kanakah model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were engaged in their fascination by astrophysicist, in dinosaurs or in the genocide of reality.
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and deserved, as Judail said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Monterey monolithic model would have predicted before.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one had been caught from these kids before?
But then Louring found a reference to an article published in German in 1944, the next year to the Kanza article, and then he forgot it, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kannaham knew about this competition article but he avoided excited to mention it in his own work.
There was no even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of Louri spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Apple, who led a clinic integrated with an inner school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Apple to teach children with learning differences were programming even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with a kind of exercise with music, and children follow their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Ashumor described as a political disability for life that required compassionate support and space forms during the course of the lifetime.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Apple called them their little teachers, and it was dedicated to help in developing methods of education that were especially appropriate for them.
Finally, Apple saw autism as a diverse continuum that was carrying an amazing variety of money and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, watching aspects of this continuum in architecture known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist, and the distributed teacher.
He went beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a piece of autism is essential.
Londo and Judith found that Kaniel was wrong when autism was infected, so the parents were the causes of the cause.
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of Prissic to expand the criteria of diagnosis that would reflect the diversity of what they called autistic "Prototype."
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes entered the view of the limited model of Kanakah by one wide and even appropriate of Apple.
These changes didn't fall in a broken show.
Cancer, when London and Judith worked between ships to reform these criteria around the world, people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before "Rami Man" was in 1988, only a little circle, commissioned by experts knew what the autism, but after the inexpensive act of Dusty Homer and the recognition of Raison Man, with four prize from the Academy of Academic, pedestrians, psychotherapieses, teachers and fathers around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, the first easy clinical evidence of using the autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to make a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of Rando Man, the changes in criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to get up, just like they predicted Lordon and Judia, in fact they hoped that this was, making people with autism and their families finally got the support and services that were deserved.
So Andrew Walcore came to blame vaccines for rising in diagnosis. A simple, powerful story, and self-destructive history as bad as the theory of Kaniel was infected.
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, autism is one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have been joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- the term neuroscience to celebrate the variety of human cognition.
One way to understand neuroscience is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's broken.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distributed, absolutely social, and it suffers from an attention deficit to detail.
No doubt, the autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Apple, which creates that the cure for the most compelling aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support and fathers with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Boston Zambias once said, "We need all the hands in cover to build the boat of humanity.
As we navigate to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
